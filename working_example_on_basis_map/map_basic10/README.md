This Go program is designed to solve the problem of counting how many numbers in an array are smaller than the current number. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### **Code Breakdown**
```go
func smallerNumbersThanCurrent(nums []int) []int {
	var x_slice = []int{}  // Initialize an empty slice to store the counts

	for _, el_1 := range nums {  // Iterate over each number in nums
		count := 0  // Initialize a counter for each number
		for _, el_2 := range nums {  // Compare the current number with every other number
			if el_1 > el_2 {  // If el_1 is greater than el_2
				count++  // Increment the counter
			}
		}
		x_slice = append(x_slice, count)  // Store the count in the result slice
	}

	return x_slice  // Return the result slice
}
```

---

### **How It Works**
This function takes an input list of numbers `nums` and returns a new list where each element represents the count of numbers in `nums` that are smaller than the corresponding element.

#### **Key Logic**
- We iterate over the array twice (nested loops).
- For each number `el_1`, we compare it with every other number `el_2`.
- If `el_1` is greater than `el_2`, we increase the count.
- Finally, we store the count in the result slice.

### **Example Walkthrough**
#### **Input**
```go
fmt.Println(smallerNumbersThanCurrent([]int{8,1,2,2,3}))
```
#### **Step-by-Step Execution**
Given `nums = [8,1,2,2,3]`, let's process each number:

1. **For `8`**: Compare with `[1,2,2,3]`
   - Greater than `1`, `2`, `2`, and `3`
   - **Count = 4**
   
2. **For `1`**: Compare with `[8,2,2,3]`
   - Greater than **0** elements
   - **Count = 0**
   
3. **For `2` (first occurrence)**: Compare with `[8,1,2,3]`
   - Greater than `1`
   - **Count = 1**
   
4. **For `2` (second occurrence)**: Compare with `[8,1,2,3]`
   - Greater than `1`
   - **Count = 1**
   
5. **For `3`**: Compare with `[8,1,2,2]`
   - Greater than `1,2,2`
   - **Count = 3**

#### **Final Output**
The function returns:
```go
[4,0,1,1,3]
```

### **Time Complexity**
- Since we have a **nested loop**, this results in a **O(nÂ²)** time complexity, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- This is because for each number, we iterate over the entire list to compare values.

---

### **Optimized Approach (Using Sorting)**
Instead of a brute-force solution, we can use sorting to improve efficiency.

```go
import "sort"

func smallerNumbersThanCurrentOptimized(nums []int) []int {
    sorted := append([]int{}, nums...) // Create a copy of nums
    sort.Ints(sorted) // Sort the array

    indexMap := make(map[int]int)
    for i, num := range sorted {
        if _, exists := indexMap[num]; !exists { 
            indexMap[num] = i // Store the first occurrence index
        }
    }

    result := make([]int, len(nums))
    for i, num := range nums {
        result[i] = indexMap[num] // Get the count from the map
    }

    return result
}
```

#### **Time Complexity of Optimized Version**
- **Sorting takes O(n log n)**
- **Creating the index map takes O(n)**
- **Final lookup takes O(n)**
- **Total time complexity: O(n log n)** (much better than O(nÂ²))

---

### **Final Thoughts**
The original solution works but is inefficient for large arrays. The optimized version uses sorting and a hashmap to reduce time complexity while achieving the same result.
