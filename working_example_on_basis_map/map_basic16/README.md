### **Explanation of the Code:**

This code demonstrates basic **map usage** in Go. Maps are collections of **key-value pairs** where each key is unique, and each key is associated with a value. Here's a breakdown of the code:

---

### **1️⃣ Declaring and Initializing a Map**

```go
r := map[string]int{"Alice": 30, "Bob": 25}
```

- **Map Declaration**: `r` is declared as a map with **string** keys and **int** values.
  - The syntax `map[string]int` indicates that the keys are of type `string` (e.g., `"Alice"`, `"Bob"`) and the values are of type `int` (e.g., `30`, `25`).
- **Map Initialization**: The map is initialized with two key-value pairs:
  - `"Alice": 30` — key `"Alice"` maps to the value `30`.
  - `"Bob": 25` — key `"Bob"` maps to the value `25`.

---

### **2️⃣ Printing the Entire Map**

```go
fmt.Println("r=", r)
```

- **Printing the Map**: The map `r` is printed as a whole. This will display the map in the format:
  ```
  r= map[Alice:30 Bob:25]
  ```
  Go automatically prints the map with the keys and values in a format like `map[key1:value1 key2:value2]`.

---

### **3️⃣ Accessing Values in the Map**

```go
fmt.Println("Alice=", r["Alice"])
fmt.Println("Bob=", r["Bob"])
```

- **Accessing Map Values**: Values are accessed using the **key**.
  - `r["Alice"]` retrieves the value associated with the key `"Alice"`, which is `30`.
  - `r["Bob"]` retrieves the value associated with the key `"Bob"`, which is `25`.

**Output:**
```
Alice= 30
Bob= 25
```

### **Key Points about Maps in Go:**

1. **Map Declaration**: You can declare a map with `map[keyType]valueType`. In this case, it's `map[string]int`, meaning the keys are strings, and the values are integers.
2. **Map Initialization**: You can initialize a map using a **map literal**. The key-value pairs are provided inside `{}`.
3. **Accessing Values**: You can access a value from the map using its key in the syntax `map[key]`.
4. **Default Values**: If you try to access a key that doesn't exist in the map, Go returns the **zero value** for the value's type (e.g., `0` for `int`, `""` for `string`).

---

### **Final Output of the Program:**

```
map:
r= map[Alice:30 Bob:25]
Alice= 30
Bob= 25
```
