This Go program demonstrates various operations on **maps** (a key-value data structure) such as:

1. **Initializing a map**
2. **Checking the length of a map**
3. **Adding new elements**
4. **Retrieving values by key**
5. **Checking for the existence of a key**
6. **Deleting elements**

Let's break down each part of the program:

---

### **1️⃣ Initializing a Map**

```go
fruits := map[string]int{"apple": 5, "banana": 7}
```

- **Map Declaration**: 
  - The map `fruits` is initialized with **keys** of type `string` (e.g., `"apple"`, `"banana"`) and **values** of type `int` (e.g., `5`, `7`).
  - The map literal `{"apple": 5, "banana": 7}` contains two entries:
    - Key `"apple"` with value `5`.
    - Key `"banana"` with value `7`.

---

### **2️⃣ Checking the Length of the Map**

```go
fmt.Println("Length of the map:", len(fruits))
```

- **Length of a Map**: 
  - The `len(fruits)` function returns the number of key-value pairs in the map. 
  - In this case, the map has two elements (`"apple"` and `"banana"`), so it will print:
    ```
    Length of the map: 2
    ```

---

### **3️⃣ Adding New Elements**

```go
fruits["orange"] = 10
fmt.Println("Added 'orange':", fruits)
```

- **Adding Elements**:
  - A new key-value pair is added to the map with the key `"orange"` and value `10`.
  - The updated `fruits` map now looks like this: `{"apple": 5, "banana": 7, "orange": 10}`.
  - This will print:
    ```
    Added 'orange': map[apple:5 banana:7 orange:10]
    ```

---

### **4️⃣ Retrieving Values by Key**

```go
applePrice := fruits["apple"]
fmt.Println("Price of apple:", applePrice)
```

- **Retrieving Elements**:
  - You can retrieve a value from a map by using its key. Here, `fruits["apple"]` fetches the value associated with the `"apple"` key, which is `5`.
  - This will print:
    ```
    Price of apple: 5
    ```

---

### **5️⃣ Checking for Existence of a Key**

```go
price, exists := fruits["kiwi"]
if exists {
    fmt.Println("Price of kiwi:", price)
} else {
    fmt.Println("Kiwi does not exist in the map")
}
```

- **Checking if a Key Exists**:
  - When retrieving a value from a map, you can also check if the key exists.
  - The expression `price, exists := fruits["kiwi"]` checks if `"kiwi"` is a valid key in the `fruits` map.
    - If `"kiwi"` exists, `exists` will be `true`, and `price` will contain the corresponding value.
    - If `"kiwi"` doesn't exist, `exists` will be `false`, and the `else` block will be executed.
  - In this case, `"kiwi"` is not in the map, so the program will print:
    ```
    Kiwi does not exist in the map
    ```

```go
orangePrice, exists := fruits["orange"]
if exists {
    fmt.Println("Price of orange:", orangePrice)
} else {
    fmt.Println("orange does not exist in the map")
}
```

- **Another Example for Checking Existence**:
  - This checks if `"orange"` is a valid key in the map. Since `"orange"` exists, the program will print:
    ```
    Price of orange: 10
    ```

---

### **6️⃣ Deleting Elements**

```go
delete(fruits, "banana")
fmt.Println("After deleting 'banana':", fruits)
```

- **Deleting Elements**:
  - The `delete(fruits, "banana")` function removes the key `"banana"` from the map `fruits`.
  - After the deletion, the map only contains the keys `"apple"` and `"orange"`.
  - This will print:
    ```
    After deleting 'banana': map[apple:5 orange:10]
    ```

---

### **Summary of the Output**

The program outputs the following:

1. The length of the map (before modification):
   ```
   Length of the map: 2
   ```

2. After adding `"orange"` to the map:
   ```
   Added 'orange': map[apple:5 banana:7 orange:10]
   ```

3. Retrieving the value for `"apple"`:
   ```
   Price of apple: 5
   ```

4. Checking if `"kiwi"` exists:
   ```
   Kiwi does not exist in the map
   ```

5. Checking if `"orange"` exists:
   ```
   Price of orange: 10
   ```

6. After deleting `"banana"` from the map:
   ```
   After deleting 'banana': map[apple:5 orange:10]
   ```

### **Key Points about Maps in Go:**

1. **Initialization**: You can initialize a map using a **map literal** or `make()`.
2. **Length**: The `len()` function returns the number of elements in a map.
3. **Adding/Modifying Elements**: You can add new elements or modify existing ones by assigning values to keys.
4. **Existence Check**: You can check if a key exists by using the `comma ok` idiom.
5. **Deleting Elements**: You can delete a key-value pair using the `delete()` function.
6. **Retrieving Elements**: Values are retrieved using their keys.
