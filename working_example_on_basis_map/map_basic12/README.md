### **Explanation of the Code**
This Go program finds the **first repeated character** in a given string.

---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**
#### **1. Function Definition: `repeatedCharacter(s string) byte`**
```go
func repeatedCharacter(s string) byte {
    var s_by byte
    var x_map = make(map[string]int) // Create a map to store character counts
```
- `s_by`: Stores the first repeated character.
- `x_map`: A map to keep track of the occurrence of each character in the string.

---

#### **2. First Pass: Check for Immediate Repeats**
```go
for i, el := range s {
    fmt.Println(i, i+1)
    if i < len(s)-1 && string(s[i+1]) == string(el) {
        s_by = byte(el)
        break
    } else {
        x_map[string(el)]++
    }
}
```
- The loop **iterates through each character** in the string.
- It checks **if a character is immediately repeated** (e.g., `"aa"` in `"aabc"`).
- If found, it assigns the **first repeated character** to `s_by` and **exits the loop**.
- Otherwise, it stores each character in `x_map`.

---

#### **3. If No Immediate Repeats, Find First Occurring Duplicate**
```go
if s_by == 0 {
    min := int([]byte("z")[0]) // ASCII value of 'z'
    fmt.Println(min)
    for key, value := range x_map {
        if value > 1 { // If character appears more than once
            if min >= int([]byte(key)[0]) {                    
                min = int([]byte(key)[0])
                s_by = []byte(key)[0]
            } else {
                s_by = []byte(key)[0]
                break
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- If `s_by` is still **0**, it means no immediate repeated characters were found.
- The function then **looks for the first occurring duplicate character** by checking `x_map`.
- It keeps track of the **smallest ASCII value** (`min`), ensuring the **earliest duplicate character** is selected.

---

### **4. Returning the Result**
```go
return s_by
```
- The function returns the **first repeated character**.

---

### **5. Main Function**
```go
func main() {
    var str = "regzueqr"
    fmt.Printf("%c\n", repeatedCharacter(str))
}
```
- Calls `repeatedCharacter("regzueqr")`
- Prints the first repeated character.

---

### **Example Walkthrough**
#### **Input**
```go
s = "regzueqr"
```

#### **Step 1: First Pass Check**
```go
s_by = 0
x_map = {
    "r": 1,
    "e": 1,
    "g": 1,
    "z": 1,
    "u": 1,
    "e": 2  // Found duplicate
}
```
- **No immediate repeated characters**, so we proceed to check `x_map`.

#### **Step 2: Find First Occurring Duplicate**
- `e` is the first character to appear more than once.
- So, `s_by = 'e'`.

#### **Output**
```
e
```

### **Time Complexity Analysis**
- **First Pass (Immediate Repeats)** â†’ **O(n)**
- **Second Pass (Check `x_map`)** â†’ **O(n)**
- **Total Time Complexity:** **O(n)**

---

### **Final Thoughts**
- This program efficiently finds the **first repeated character** in a string.
- It **checks for immediate duplicates first**, then looks for repeated characters in `x_map`.
- The approach ensures an **O(n) time complexity**, making it efficient.
