This Go code snippet is designed to find duplicate elements in a slice `arr` and store their indices in a slice of maps `slice`. Let's break down the logic and explain each part of the code.

### Code Breakdown:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Define an array of integers
	var arr = []int{1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3}

	// Declare a slice to store maps
	var slice = []map[int]int{}

	// Outer loop to iterate over the elements of the array
	for i, el_1 := range arr {
		// Inner loop to compare the current element with the rest of the array
		for j := i + 1; j < len(arr); j++ {
			// Create a new map to store the pair of indices
			x_map := make(map[int]int)

			// Check if we have found a duplicate element
			if el_1 == arr[j] {
				// If a duplicate is found, store the indices in the map
				x_map[i] = j

				// Append the map to the slice
				slice = append(slice, x_map)
			}
		}
	}

	// Print the slice of maps that contains the indices of duplicate elements
	fmt.Println(slice)
}
```

### Explanation:

#### **1. `arr = []int{1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3}`:**
   - This is the array (or slice) of integers, which contains some duplicate values (`1` and `3`).

#### **2. `slice = []map[int]int{}`:**
   - This initializes an empty slice of maps, where each map will store a pair of indices. Specifically, the map will have the format `map[index1] = index2`, indicating that the element at `index1` in the `arr` is equal to the element at `index2`.

#### **3. Outer `for` loop:**
   ```go
   for i, el_1 := range arr {
   ```
   - This loop iterates through the `arr` slice. `i` is the index, and `el_1` is the element at index `i` in the array.

#### **4. Inner `for` loop:**
   ```go
   for j := i + 1; j < len(arr); j++ {
   ```
   - This nested loop compares each element `el_1` with the remaining elements in the array (starting from index `i + 1` to avoid comparing an element with itself).
   - `j` is the index of the second element in the comparison.

#### **5. Create a map for the indices:**
   ```go
   x_map := make(map[int]int)
   ```
   - A new map `x_map` is created in each iteration of the inner loop. This map will store the pair of indices if a match is found.

#### **6. Check for duplicates:**
   ```go
   if el_1 == arr[j] {
   ```
   - If the elements at indices `i` and `j` are equal (`el_1 == arr[j]`), we know that we have found a duplicate value.

#### **7. Store the indices in the map:**
   ```go
   x_map[i] = j
   ```
   - If a match is found, the map `x_map` is updated to store the pair of indices where the duplicate value occurs. The key `i` is the index of the first occurrence, and the value `j` is the index of the second occurrence.

#### **8. Append the map to the slice:**
   ```go
   slice = append(slice, x_map)
   ```
   - After finding the duplicate and storing the indices in `x_map`, the map is appended to the `slice`.

#### **9. Final Output:**
   ```go
   fmt.Println(slice)
   ```
   - Once both loops have completed, the `slice` is printed. This slice will contain all maps of index pairs where the elements in `arr` are equal.

### **Example Walkthrough:**

For the input `arr = []int{1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3}`:

1. **First Iteration (i = 0, el_1 = 1):**
   - The inner loop compares `1` with the rest of the elements (`2`, `3`, `1`, `1`, `3`).
   - A match is found at `j = 3` and `j = 4`. So, the maps `map[0:3]` and `map[0:4]` are appended to the `slice`.

2. **Second Iteration (i = 1, el_1 = 2):**
   - The inner loop compares `2` with the elements (`3`, `1`, `1`, `3`), but no match is found. Therefore, no maps are added.

3. **Third Iteration (i = 2, el_1 = 3):**
   - The inner loop compares `3` with the elements (`1`, `1`, `3`).
   - A match is found at `j = 5`. So, the map `map[2:5]` is added to the `slice`.

4. **Fourth Iteration (i = 3, el_1 = 1):**
   - The inner loop compares `1` with the elements (`1`, `3`).
   - No new matches are found since they were already handled in the first iteration.

5. **Fifth Iteration (i = 4, el_1 = 1):**
   - Same as the previous iteration, no new matches are found.

6. **Sixth Iteration (i = 5, el_1 = 3):**
   - Same as the third iteration, no new matches are found.

### **Final Output:**
```go
[{0:3} {0:4} {2:5}]
```

This output indicates the following:
- The value `1` at index `0` is duplicated at indices `3` and `4`.
- The value `3` at index `2` is duplicated at index `5`.

### **Summary of Key Points:**

1. The **outer loop** (`i`) iterates through each element in the `arr`.
2. The **inner loop** (`j`) compares each element with all subsequent elements.
3. **Maps** are created to store the pairs of indices where duplicate elements are found.
4. The **slice** holds all the maps with index pairs where duplicates occur.
