Let's break down and explain each part of the provided Go code step by step.

### Full Code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UTC().UnixNano()) // Initialize random number generator with the current Unix timestamp

	n := 5  // The number of random numbers to generate
	a := []int{}  // Initialize an empty slice of integers

	// Generate 'n' random numbers and store them in slice 'a'
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		k := rand.Intn(100) // Generate a random number between 0 and 99
		a = append(a, k)    // Append the random number to the slice 'a'
	}
	fmt.Println(a)  // Print the slice 'a' after populating it with random numbers

	// Using a traditional 'for' loop to print each element of 'a' with 1 added
	fmt.Println("for")
	for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
		fmt.Print(a[i]+1, " ")  // Print the value at index 'i' of slice 'a' with 1 added
	}
	fmt.Println()  // Newline after the first loop

	// Using a 'for range' loop to print each element of 'a' with 1 added
	fmt.Println("for range")
	for _, v := range a {
		fmt.Print(v+1, " ")  // Print the value 'v' (element of 'a') with 1 added
	}
}
```

### Explanation:

#### 1. **Importing Packages**:
   - **`fmt`**: This package is used for formatted input and output operations, such as printing values to the console.
   - **`math/rand`**: This package is used to generate pseudo-random numbers. It requires a seed to generate a different sequence of numbers on each program run.
   - **`time`**: This package provides functionality to get the current system time. It's used here to generate a unique random seed based on the current Unix timestamp.

#### 2. **Initializing Random Seed**:
   - **`rand.Seed(time.Now().UTC().UnixNano())`**:
     - This line sets the seed for the random number generator using the current Unix timestamp in nanoseconds. This ensures that the random numbers generated are different each time the program is run.
   
#### 3. **Generating Random Numbers**:
   - **`n := 5`**: This line declares a variable `n` and assigns it a value of `5`. This variable represents the number of random numbers to generate.
   
   - **`a := []int{}`**: This line initializes an empty slice of integers `a`, which will hold the random numbers.

   - **`for i := 0; i < n; i++`**:
     - This `for` loop runs 5 times (`n = 5`), generating 5 random numbers and appending them to the slice `a`.
   
   - **`k := rand.Intn(100)`**:
     - This generates a random integer between `0` and `99` using `rand.Intn(100)`. It returns a pseudo-random number within this range.
   
   - **`a = append(a, k)`**:
     - This line appends the generated random number `k` to the slice `a`.

   - **`fmt.Println(a)`**:
     - After the loop finishes, this line prints the slice `a`, which contains 5 random integers. The output will vary each time because of the randomness.

#### 4. **Using a Traditional `for` Loop**:
   - **`fmt.Println("for")`**:
     - This prints the string `"for"`, indicating the start of the first loop.
   
   - **`for i := 0; i < len(a); i++`**:
     - This is a traditional `for` loop that iterates over the indices of the slice `a`. It starts at index `0` and continues until it reaches `len(a)-1` (the last index of the slice).
   
   - **`fmt.Print(a[i]+1, " ")`**:
     - Inside the loop, it prints each element at index `i` in the slice `a`, with 1 added to the value. The result is printed with a space after each number.
     - **Example**: If `a = [3, 7, 2, 9, 1]`, the output will be: `4 8 3 10 2`.

   - **`fmt.Println()`**:
     - This prints a newline after the first loop completes.

#### 5. **Using a `for range` Loop**:
   - **`fmt.Println("for range")`**:
     - This prints the string `"for range"`, indicating the start of the second loop.
   
   - **`for _, v := range a`**:
     - This is a `for range` loop, which iterates over the elements of the slice `a`. The `range` keyword gives both the index and value of each element, but here we are using the underscore `_` to ignore the index and only use the value `v`.
   
   - **`fmt.Print(v+1, " ")`**:
     - Inside the loop, it prints the value `v` (the element of the slice) with 1 added to it, followed by a space.
     - **Example**: If `a = [3, 7, 2, 9, 1]`, the output will be: `4 8 3 10 2`.

### Final Output:

- The output of this program will vary each time because the slice `a` contains random numbers.
- Here's an example of the possible output for a given run (where the randomly generated numbers could be `[29, 72, 53, 88, 47]`):

```
[29 72 53 88 47]
for
30 73 54 89 48 
for range
30 73 54 89 48 
```

### Key Concepts:
- **`rand.Seed`**: Initializes the random number generator to produce different results each time the program is run.
- **Slice (`a`)**: A dynamically-sized array that holds random integers.
- **Traditional `for` Loop**: Loops over a range of indices and modifies the slice elements by index.
- **`for range` Loop**: A simpler way to loop through slices, providing access to the elements directly, without using indices.

### Conclusion:
The program demonstrates how to:
1. Generate a slice of random integers.
2. Modify and print the slice using both a traditional `for` loop (by index) and a `for range` loop (by value).
3. Print the results after each modification step.
