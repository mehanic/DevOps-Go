Let's break down the code step by step:

### 1. **Iterating Over a Slice (`sl`):**
```go
sl := []int64{9, 8, 7}
for key, value := range sl {
    fmt.Printf("key: %v, val: %v \n", key, value)
}
```
- This `for` loop is iterating over the slice `sl` which contains the elements `{9, 8, 7}`.
- The `range` keyword returns two values in each iteration:
  - `key`: the index of the element in the slice (0, 1, 2).
  - `value`: the value of the element at that index (9, 8, 7).
  
**Output**:
```
key: 0, val: 9
key: 1, val: 8
key: 2, val: 7
```

### 2. **Iterating Over a Slice Without Using the Key:**
```go
for _, value := range sl {
    fmt.Println(value)
}
```
- This loop is similar to the previous one, but here we are using `_` (underscore) to ignore the `key` value and only use `value`.
- This simply prints each value in the slice (`9`, `8`, `7`).

**Output**:
```
9
8
7
```

### 3. **Iterating Over a Map (`ages`):**
```go
ages := map[string]int{
    "Андрей":    30,
    "Анастасия": 25,
}
for key, value := range ages {
    fmt.Println(key)
    fmt.Println(value)
}
```
- The `ages` map holds two key-value pairs where keys are strings (`"Андрей"`, `"Анастасия"`) and values are integers (`30`, `25`).
- The `range` keyword here returns two values in each iteration:
  - `key`: the key of the map (name in this case).
  - `value`: the corresponding value of that key (age in this case).
- This loop prints both the key and the value for each entry in the map.

**Output**:
```
Андрей
30
Анастасия
25
```

### 4. **Iterating Over a String by Index:**
```go
word := "слёрм"
for i := 0; i < len(word); i++ {
    fmt.Println(word[i])
    fmt.Printf("%T", word[i])
}
```
- `word` is a string `"слёрм"`.
- This loop iterates over each byte in the string by its index (`i`). The `len(word)` is used to determine the length of the string (in bytes).
- Each `word[i]` accesses the byte at index `i` and prints its numeric value (the UTF-8 byte value), followed by the type (`uint8`).

**Output** (in Unicode byte values):
```
209
uint8
129
uint8
208
uint8
187
uint8
209
uint8
145
uint8
209
uint8
128
uint8
208
uint8
188
uint8
```

- These numbers represent the UTF-8 byte encoding for the characters in the string `"слёрм"`. UTF-8 uses multiple bytes to represent characters from non-Latin alphabets like Cyrillic.
  - For example, the character `'с'` (U+0441) is represented by two bytes: `209 129`.
  - Each character in the word `"слёрм"` requires multiple bytes to be properly encoded in UTF-8.

### 5. **Iterating Over a String by Unicode Code Points:**
```go
for key, value := range word {
    fmt.Println(key)
    fmt.Println(value)
    fmt.Printf("%T", value)
}
```
- This loop iterates over the string `word` (`"слёрм"`) using `range`. This way, `value` is the **Unicode code point** of each character (not the byte value).
- The `key` is the index of the character in the string.
- `value` is the Unicode code point of the character, which is of type `int32`.

**Output**:
```
0
1089
int32
2
1083
int32
4
1105
int32
6
1088
int32
8
1084
int32
```

- These are the Unicode code points for each character in `"слёрм"`.
  - For example, the character `'с'` has the Unicode code point `1089`.
  - Each character's code point is printed along with its type (`int32`).

### **Summary of Key Points:**

1. **`range` on Slice**:
   - The `range` operator can be used to iterate over a slice. It returns two values: the index (`key`) and the value at that index. If you don’t need the index, you can use the blank identifier `_` to ignore it.

2. **`range` on Map**:
   - When iterating over a map, `range` returns the key and value for each entry. You can process them as needed.

3. **Iterating Over String by Index**:
   - When you iterate over a string by index using `len()`, you access the bytes of the string (UTF-8 encoding). This is useful for inspecting the byte values of characters, but for non-ASCII characters, it may require multiple bytes.

4. **Iterating Over String by Unicode Code Points**:
   - Using `range` directly on a string allows you to iterate over the **Unicode code points** (int32) rather than bytes. This is important for correctly handling multi-byte characters like Cyrillic characters.

### Conclusion:

- **`range`** is a powerful tool in Go for iterating over slices, maps, and strings. 
- When iterating over **strings**, `range` gives you the Unicode code point of each character, which is helpful when working with multi-byte characters (such as in non-Latin scripts).
