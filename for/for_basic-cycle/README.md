This Go program demonstrates how a **`for`** loop works, and how the loop variable and other variables are updated during each iteration. Let's break it down step by step:

### **Program Breakdown:**

```go
sumi := 5
fmt.Println("start cycle")
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    // enter loop
    fmt.Println("i=", i)
    fmt.Println("before sumi=", sumi)
    sumi = sumi + 1
    fmt.Println("after sumi=", sumi)
    fmt.Println("")
    // exit loop
}
fmt.Println("end cycle")
fmt.Println(sumi)
```

### **1. Initial Setup:**

- The variable `sumi` is initialized to `5`.
- The program prints `"start cycle"`, signaling the beginning of the loop.

### **2. The `for` Loop:**

The `for` loop is set up as follows:
- **Initialization:** `i := 0` — This initializes the loop variable `i` to 0.
- **Condition:** `i < 5` — The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 5.
- **After-action:** `i++` — After each iteration, the loop variable `i` is incremented by 1.

### **3. Loop Iterations:**

The loop will run 5 times, with `i` ranging from `0` to `4`. Here's what happens during each iteration:

- **First iteration (`i = 0`):**
  - Before the loop body executes, `sumi` is 5.
  - It prints the current value of `i`, which is `0`, and the current value of `sumi`, which is `5`.
  - Then, `sumi` is incremented by 1 (`sumi = sumi + 1`), making `sumi = 6`.
  - After that, it prints the updated value of `sumi`, which is `6`.

- **Second iteration (`i = 1`):**
  - Before the loop body executes, `sumi` is 6 (from the previous iteration).
  - It prints the current value of `i`, which is `1`, and the current value of `sumi`, which is `6`.
  - Then, `sumi` is incremented by 1 (`sumi = sumi + 1`), making `sumi = 7`.
  - After that, it prints the updated value of `sumi`, which is `7`.

- **Third iteration (`i = 2`):**
  - Before the loop body executes, `sumi` is 7 (from the previous iteration).
  - It prints the current value of `i`, which is `2`, and the current value of `sumi`, which is `7`.
  - Then, `sumi` is incremented by 1 (`sumi = sumi + 1`), making `sumi = 8`.
  - After that, it prints the updated value of `sumi`, which is `8`.

- **Fourth iteration (`i = 3`):**
  - Before the loop body executes, `sumi` is 8 (from the previous iteration).
  - It prints the current value of `i`, which is `3`, and the current value of `sumi`, which is `8`.
  - Then, `sumi` is incremented by 1 (`sumi = sumi + 1`), making `sumi = 9`.
  - After that, it prints the updated value of `sumi`, which is `9`.

- **Fifth iteration (`i = 4`):**
  - Before the loop body executes, `sumi` is 9 (from the previous iteration).
  - It prints the current value of `i`, which is `4`, and the current value of `sumi`, which is `9`.
  - Then, `sumi` is incremented by 1 (`sumi = sumi + 1`), making `sumi = 10`.
  - After that, it prints the updated value of `sumi`, which is `10`.

### **4. Exiting the Loop:**

- After the fifth iteration, `i` is incremented to `5`.
- The condition `i < 5` is no longer true because `i` is now equal to `5`.
- The loop terminates.

### **5. Final Output:**

- The program prints `"end cycle"` to indicate the end of the loop.
- Finally, the value of `sumi` is printed, which is `10`.

### **Expected Output:**
```
start cycle
i= 0
before sumi= 5
after sumi= 6

i= 1
before sumi= 6
after sumi= 7

i= 2
before sumi= 7
after sumi= 8

i= 3
before sumi= 8
after sumi= 9

i= 4
before sumi= 9
after sumi= 10

end cycle
10
```

### **Explanation of the Rules:**
1. **Loop initialization**: The loop variable `i` is initialized at the start of the loop.
2. **Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < 5`.
3. **Loop body**: Inside the loop:
   - The program prints the current value of `i`.
   - It then prints the value of `sumi` before and after it gets incremented by `1`.
4. **Loop exit**: The loop exits once `i` reaches 5, at which point the condition `i < 5` becomes false.
5. **Final result**: After the loop finishes, the final value of `sumi` is printed, which is `10` due to the increment in each iteration.

In summary, this program demonstrates how to control the flow of execution using loops and how to modify variables during each iteration. It shows how to print variable values before and after a change, giving insight into how values are updated step by step inside a loop.
