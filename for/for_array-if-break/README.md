This Go program demonstrates the use of **loops** and **the `break` statement** to control the flow of a program, modifying the elements of an array and stopping early based on a condition.

## âœ… **Step-by-step explanation:**

### 1. **Array Declaration and Initialization**
```go
numbers := [...]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12323}
```
- An **array `numbers`** is declared with **8 elements**: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12323}`.
- The **`[...]`** syntax allows the compiler to automatically determine the number of elements in the array.

---

### 2. **Find the Length of the Array**
```go
n := len(numbers)
```
- The `len()` function calculates the **length of the array**, which is **8**, and stores it in the variable `n`.

---

### 3. **Print the Original Array**
```go
fmt.Println(numbers)
```
- This prints the **original state of the array**:
```
[1 2 3 4 5 7 8 12323]
```

---

### 4. **Loop Through the Array and Modify Elements**
```go
for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
	if i == 2 {
		break
	}
	numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2
}
```
- The **`for` loop** iterates through the array from index `0` to `n-1` (which is `7` for this array).
- The loop checks if the **index `i` is equal to `2`**:
  - If `i == 2`, it **breaks the loop**, stopping any further iterations and exiting the loop.
  - If `i != 2`, it multiplies the value at index `i` by `2`.
  
---

### 5. **Print the Modified Array**
```go
fmt.Println(numbers)
```
- After modification, the array becomes:
```
[2 4 3 4 5 7 8 12323]
```
- The elements at indices `0` and `1` have been **doubled** (values `1` and `2` become `2` and `4`, respectively).
- The **loop stops at index `2`** due to the `break` statement, so the value at index `2` (which is `3`) remains unchanged.
- The rest of the array (from index `3` onward) **remains the same** because the loop was terminated before reaching those indices.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Detailed Breakdown of Modifications:**

| Index | Original Value | Condition        | Action                        | New Value |
|-------|----------------|------------------|-------------------------------|-----------|
| 0     | 1              | `i != 2`         | `1 * 2 = 2`                   | 2         |
| 1     | 2              | `i != 2`         | `2 * 2 = 4`                   | 4         |
| 2     | 3              | `i == 2 (break)` | **Breaks loop without modifying** | 3         |
| 3     | 4              | `loop stopped`    | **No changes**                 | 4         |
| 4     | 5              | `loop stopped`    | **No changes**                 | 5         |
| 5     | 7              | `loop stopped`    | **No changes**                 | 7         |
| 6     | 8              | `loop stopped`    | **No changes**                 | 8         |
| 7     | 12323          | `loop stopped`    | **No changes**                 | 12323     |

### 6. **Final Output:**

#### Initial Array:
```
[1 2 3 4 5 7 8 12323]
```

#### Array after modification:
```
[2 4 3 4 5 7 8 12323]
```

## ðŸ“Œ **General Rule:**

This program demonstrates how to:
1. **Iterate through an array**, modifying its elements conditionally.
2. **Use a `break` statement** to terminate the loop early if a specific condition (e.g., `i == 2`) is met.
