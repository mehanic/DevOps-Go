Let's break down the Go code step by step to explain what each part is doing:

### Code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    n := 5
    a := []int{}
    fmt.Println(len(a))
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        k := 5
        a = append(a, k)
    }
    fmt.Println(len(a))
}
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Variable Initialization**:
   ```go
   n := 5
   a := []int{}
   ```
   - `n := 5`: This initializes a variable `n` with the value `5`. This will be used as the limit for the `for` loop and controls how many times the loop will run.
   - `a := []int{}`: This initializes an empty slice `a` of type `[]int` (a slice of integers). The slice `a` starts as empty, meaning it has no elements at this point.

2. **Print the Length of the Slice `a`**:
   ```go
   fmt.Println(len(a))
   ```
   - `len(a)` returns the length of the slice `a`. Since `a` is initially empty, `len(a)` will return `0`.
   - The program prints `0` because the slice `a` has no elements at the start.

3. **For Loop**:
   ```go
   for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
       k := 5
       a = append(a, k)
   }
   ```
   - This is a `for` loop that will run `5` times (`i` starts from 0 and goes up to `4`, as `n = 5`).
   - Inside the loop, the value `k` is set to `5` on each iteration, and `k` is appended to the slice `a`.
   - The `append()` function is used to add `k` to the slice `a`. It returns a new slice with `k` added at the end. The `a = append(a, k)` line ensures that the new slice (with `k` added) is saved back into `a`.

   Let's look at the changes to the slice `a` after each iteration of the loop:
   - **1st iteration (`i = 0`)**: `a = append(a, 5)` → `a = [5]`
   - **2nd iteration (`i = 1`)**: `a = append(a, 5)` → `a = [5, 5]`
   - **3rd iteration (`i = 2`)**: `a = append(a, 5)` → `a = [5, 5, 5]`
   - **4th iteration (`i = 3`)**: `a = append(a, 5)` → `a = [5, 5, 5, 5]`
   - **5th iteration (`i = 4`)**: `a = append(a, 5)` → `a = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`

   After the loop finishes, the slice `a` contains 5 elements, all with the value `5`.

4. **Print the Length of the Slice `a` Again**:
   ```go
   fmt.Println(len(a))
   ```
   - After the loop finishes, the slice `a` contains `5` elements. Therefore, `len(a)` will return `5`.
   - The program prints `5` because there are 5 elements in the slice `a` after the loop completes.

### Output:
```
0
5
```

### Summary:
- **Initial length of the slice `a`**: Before the loop starts, `a` is an empty slice, so `len(a)` prints `0`.
- **Appending values in the loop**: During the loop, the number `5` is appended to the slice `a` 5 times, resulting in a slice with 5 elements, all equal to `5`.
- **Final length of the slice `a`**: After the loop completes, the slice contains 5 elements, so `len(a)` prints `5`.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Slices**: In Go, slices are dynamic arrays, and the `append()` function is used to add elements to a slice, potentially increasing its size.
2. **`len()` function**: The `len()` function in Go returns the number of elements in a slice or array.
3. **`append()` function**: The `append()` function in Go creates a new slice by adding an element to the end of the original slice.
