Let's break down this Go code step by step:

### **Code Explanation:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	numbers := [...]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12323}  // 1. Define the numbers array
	n := len(numbers)                             // 2. Get the length of the numbers array
	sumi := 0                                      // 3. Initialize the sum variable
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {                       // 4. Loop through the array
		sumi = sumi + numbers[i]                  // 5. Add the current number to the sum
	}
	fmt.Println(sumi)                              // 6. Print the sum
}
```

### **Step-by-step Breakdown:**

#### 1. **Defining the `numbers` array:**
```go
numbers := [...]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12323}
```
- The `numbers` array is defined with 8 integers: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12323]`.
- The `[...]` syntax tells Go to automatically infer the size of the array based on the number of elements provided.

#### 2. **Getting the length of the `numbers` array:**
```go
n := len(numbers)
```
- The `len()` function returns the length of the array `numbers`.
- In this case, `n` will be `8` because there are 8 elements in the array.

#### 3. **Initializing the `sumi` variable:**
```go
sumi := 0
```
- The variable `sumi` is initialized to `0`. This variable will store the running total or sum of the numbers in the array.

#### 4. **Looping through the `numbers` array:**
```go
for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
```
- This `for` loop will iterate over the entire array, starting from index `0` up to index `n-1`. The condition `i < n` ensures that the loop runs for all elements in the array.
- In this case, `n = 8`, so the loop will run 8 times (from `i = 0` to `i = 7`).

#### 5. **Adding each number to `sumi`:**
```go
sumi = sumi + numbers[i]
```
- Inside the loop, the value of `numbers[i]` (the current element in the array) is added to the `sumi` variable.
- Initially, `sumi` is `0`, so on the first iteration, it will add the first element `numbers[0]` (which is `1`) to `sumi`, making `sumi = 1`.
- On the second iteration, `numbers[1]` (which is `2`) will be added to `sumi`, making `sumi = 3`, and so on for all the elements in the array.

#### 6. **Printing the final sum:**
```go
fmt.Println(sumi)
```
- After the loop completes, `sumi` contains the sum of all the elements in the array.
- The `fmt.Println(sumi)` prints the final value of `sumi`, which is the total sum of the numbers in the array.

### **Sum Calculation:**
Let's manually calculate the sum of the numbers in the array:

- `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 7 + 8 + 12323 = 12353`

So, the final output of the program will be:
```
12353
```

### **Summary:**
- This Go program defines an array of integers, computes the sum of its elements using a `for` loop, and prints the result.
- The sum of the elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12323]` is `12353`.
