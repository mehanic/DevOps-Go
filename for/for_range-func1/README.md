Let's break down and explain the Go code step by step:

### Code Breakdown:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Planets []string

// метод типа Planets
func (planets Planets) terraform() {
	for i := range planets {
		planets[i] = "Новый " + planets[i]
	}
}

func main() {
	planets := []string{
		"Меркурий", "Венера", "Земля", "Марс",
		"Юпитер", "Сатурн", "Уран", "Нептун",
	}
	Planets(planets[3:4]).terraform()
	Planets(planets[6:]).terraform()
	fmt.Println(planets)
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

#### 1. **Type Definition (`Planets`)**:
```go
type Planets []string
```
- Here, a new type called `Planets` is defined, which is an alias for a slice of strings (`[]string`). This allows you to define methods specifically for this type, making it behave differently than a regular slice of strings.

#### 2. **Method on the `Planets` Type (`terraform`)**:
```go
func (planets Planets) terraform() {
	for i := range planets {
		planets[i] = "Новый " + planets[i]
	}
}
```
- This is a method with the receiver `planets` of type `Planets`. It is called `terraform`.
- The method loops through each planet in the `Planets` slice and updates its value by prepending the string `"Новый "` (which means "New" in Russian) to the planet's name.
- **Important**: This method modifies the copy of the slice (`planets`), but since it's working on a copy (not a pointer), changes made to the slice will not affect the original `planets` slice in the `main()` function.

#### 3. **Main Function**:

```go
planets := []string{
	"Меркурий", "Венера", "Земля", "Марс",
	"Юпитер", "Сатурн", "Уран", "Нептун",
}
```
- A slice of strings `planets` is created, containing the names of the planets in the Solar System in Russian.

```go
Planets(planets[3:4]).terraform()
```
- This line creates a new `Planets` slice containing only the 4th element (`"Марс"`) from the `planets` slice (`planets[3:4]`), converts that slice to the `Planets` type, and then calls the `terraform()` method on it.
- The `terraform()` method modifies the planet `"Марс"` by prepending `"Новый "` to it, so `"Марс"` becomes `"Новый Марс"`.
- However, since we're working with a **copy** of the slice and not the original one, this change doesn't affect the original `planets` slice.

```go
Planets(planets[6:]).terraform()
```
- This line does a similar operation. It creates a new `Planets` slice containing elements from index 6 onward (`planets[6:]`), which corresponds to the planets `"Уран"` and `"Нептун"`, converts it to the `Planets` type, and calls the `terraform()` method.
- The method prepends `"Новый "` to each of these planets, making `"Уран"` become `"Новый Уран"` and `"Нептун"` become `"Новый Нептун"`.
- As before, these changes only affect the **copy** of the slice, not the original `planets` slice.

#### 4. **Printing the `planets` Slice**:
```go
fmt.Println(planets)
```
- After the modifications (which only affected the slices created in the `terraform()` method), the original `planets` slice is printed.
- Since the `terraform()` method worked on copies of parts of the original slice and did not modify the original slice directly, the printed result is:
```
[Меркурий Венера Земля Марс Юпитер Сатурн Уран Нептун]
```

### Key Concepts:

1. **Slice and Type Alias**: 
   - The program creates a type alias `Planets` for a slice of strings (`[]string`). This allows you to attach methods to slices of strings, which you normally cannot do directly in Go.

2. **Method on a Slice**:
   - The method `terraform()` is defined for the `Planets` type, which allows you to modify the contents of a slice. The method updates the names of planets in the slice by prepending `"Новый "` to each planet's name.

3. **Pass-by-Value**:
   - In Go, when you pass a slice (or array) to a method, it's passed by value (a copy of the slice is passed). This means that modifications made to the slice inside the method do not affect the original slice outside the method, unless you pass a pointer to the slice (which is not done here).

4. **Slicing a Slice**:
   - The syntax `planets[3:4]` and `planets[6:]` creates new slices from parts of the original `planets` slice.
     - `planets[3:4]` gives a slice containing only `"Марс"`.
     - `planets[6:]` gives a slice containing `"Уран"` and `"Нептун"`.

### Summary:
The program defines a type `Planets` (which is a slice of strings), attaches a method `terraform()` to this type, and then applies this method to specific slices of the `planets` array. However, the changes made inside `terraform()` do not affect the original `planets` slice, as slices are passed by value in Go.
