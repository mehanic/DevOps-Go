This Go program demonstrates how to initialize and modify elements of an array. Let's break it down step by step:

### **Code Explanation:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	n := 5
	numbers := [10]int{}  // Declare an array of size 10 with all elements initialized to 0
	fmt.Println(numbers)  // Print the array before modification

	// Loop to modify the first 'n' elements of the array
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		numbers[i] = 5  // Assign 5 to each of the first 'n' elements
	}

	fmt.Println(numbers)  // Print the array after modification
}
```

### **Step-by-step Breakdown:**

1. **Array Initialization**:
   ```go
   numbers := [10]int{}
   ```
   - This declares an array named `numbers` with a size of `10` (`[10]int`). By default, the elements of an integer array in Go are initialized to `0`. So, after this line, the `numbers` array looks like this:
     ```
     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     ```

2. **Printing the Array Before Modification**:
   ```go
   fmt.Println(numbers)
   ```
   - This prints the initial state of the `numbers` array, which is all zeros:
     ```
     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
     ```

3. **Modifying the Array Elements**:
   ```go
   for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
       numbers[i] = 5
   }
   ```
   - This `for` loop iterates over the first `n` elements of the array (where `n = 5`), and sets each element to `5`.
   - During the loop, the elements at indices `0, 1, 2, 3, and 4` are modified to `5`. After this loop, the array looks like this:
     ```
     [5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
     ```

4. **Printing the Array After Modification**:
   ```go
   fmt.Println(numbers)
   ```
   - This prints the modified state of the `numbers` array, which now looks like this:
     ```
     [5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0]
     ```

### **Summary:**
- The program first initializes an array of size `10` with all elements set to `0`.
- It then modifies the first `5` elements of the array, setting each of them to `5`.
- The array is printed twice: once before the modification (showing all zeros) and once after the modification (showing the first five `5`s, followed by zeros for the remaining elements).

### **Key Concepts:**
- **Array Initialization:** The array is initialized with a size of `10`, and all elements are set to `0` by default for an integer array.
- **Array Modification:** The program modifies the first `n` elements (in this case, `n = 5`) to `5`.
- **Looping Through Arrays:** A `for` loop is used to iterate over a subset of the array and modify its elements.

### **Output:**
```
[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
[5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0]
```
