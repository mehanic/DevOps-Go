In this Go program, the `break` statement is used to exit from a loop prematurely. Let's break it down step by step:

### 1. **Infinite Loop (`for {}`)**

```go
for {
    fmt.Println(i)
    if i >= 10 {
        break
    }
    i++
}
```

- The loop is written as `for {}`, which is an **infinite loop**. 
  - This type of loop has no condition, so it would continue running forever unless manually interrupted using a statement like `break`.
  
### 2. **Printing the Value of `i`**

```go
fmt.Println(i)
```

- Inside the loop, the current value of `i` is printed on each iteration. Initially, `i` is 0.
  
### 3. **The `if` Condition**

```go
if i >= 10 {
    break
}
```

- This checks if the value of `i` is greater than or equal to 10.
- When `i` reaches 10, the condition `i >= 10` will evaluate to `true`, and the `break` statement will be executed.
  
### 4. **Breaking the Loop**

```go
break
```

- The `break` statement immediately **exits the loop**.
- When `i` reaches 10, the `break` stops the loop, and no further iterations are performed.

### 5. **Incrementing `i`**

```go
i++
```

- If the `if` condition is not met (i.e., `i` is less than 10), `i` is incremented by 1 on each iteration. This allows the loop to eventually reach the value of 10.

### **Program Flow Summary**

- The loop starts with `i = 0` and prints the current value of `i` (initially 0).
- On each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
- When `i` reaches 10, the condition `if i >= 10` becomes true, and the `break` statement is executed, which exits the loop.
- The final output will be the numbers 0 to 10 printed sequentially, and then the program exits.

### **Output of the Program**

```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

Once `i` reaches 10, the `break` statement is triggered, and the loop ends.

### **Key Concepts**
- **Infinite Loop**: A loop with no stopping condition, often used with a `break` to exit at a specific point.
- **`break`**: Exits the loop immediately, regardless of where it is in the iteration.
- **Loop Control**: By modifying the value of `i` and using a condition (`if`), the loop can be stopped after a specific number of iterations.
