The Go program you've provided generates a multiplication table. Let me break it down step by step and explain the rules:

### Code Breakdown

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// EXERCISE: Get the `max` from the user
//           And create the table according to that.

const max = 5

func main() {
	// print the header
	fmt.Printf("%5s", "X")
	for i := 0; i <= max; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("%5d", i)
	}
	fmt.Println()

	for i := 0; i <= max; i++ {
		// print the vertical header
		fmt.Printf("%5d", i)

		// print the cells
		for j := 0; j <= max; j++ {
			fmt.Printf("%5d", i*j)
		}
		fmt.Println()
	}
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Package Declaration**:
   - `package main`: This tells Go that the code belongs to the `main` package, which is used for executable programs. The `main` function will be the entry point of the program.

2. **Importing the `fmt` package**:
   - `import "fmt"`: The `fmt` package is imported to allow formatted I/O operations, such as printing to the console.

3. **Constant Declaration**:
   - `const max = 5`: A constant `max` is defined with the value `5`. This value will be used to control the size of the multiplication table (i.e., the range of numbers for both the header and the multiplication values).

4. **Main Function**:
   - `func main() { ... }`: The main function is the starting point of execution. This is where the program logic resides.

5. **Printing the Header**:
   - `fmt.Printf("%5s", "X")`: This line prints the letter `"X"` at the top left corner of the table. The `%5s` ensures that it takes up 5 spaces in the output, creating space for other values.
   - `for i := 0; i <= max; i++`: This `for` loop prints the numbers from `0` to `max` across the top row of the table. Each number is printed with a width of 5 spaces using the format `%5d`.
   - `fmt.Println()`: After the header row is printed, this function prints a newline to separate the header from the table.

6. **Printing the Multiplication Table**:
   - `for i := 0; i <= max; i++`: This loop iterates over the rows of the multiplication table, from `0` to `max`. For each row:
     - `fmt.Printf("%5d", i)`: This prints the row's label (the number `i`) in a width of 5 spaces.
     - `for j := 0; j <= max; j++`: This nested loop iterates over the columns of the table, printing the product of `i * j` for each column.
     - `fmt.Printf("%5d", i*j)`: This prints the value of `i * j`, ensuring it takes up 5 spaces.
     - `fmt.Println()`: After all columns for a row are printed, this prints a newline to move to the next row.

### How it Works:
- The outer loop (`for i := 0; i <= max; i++`) controls the rows of the table.
- The inner loop (`for j := 0; j <= max; j++`) controls the columns of the table.
- The multiplication table is constructed by multiplying the row index `i` with the column index `j` for each cell in the table.

### Example Output:
For `max = 5`, the output of the program will look like this:

```
    X    0    1    2    3    4    5
    0    0    0    0    0    0    0
    1    0    1    2    3    4    5
    2    0    2    4    6    8   10
    3    0    3    6    9   12   15
    4    0    4    8   12   16   20
    5    0    5   10   15   20   25
```

### Explanation of Output:
- The first row is the header, with the numbers from `0` to `max` printed across the top, starting from the letter `"X"`.
- The first column in each row represents the row number (`i`), and the cells are the result of multiplying `i` by `j`, where `i` is the row number and `j` is the column number.
- The table structure shows the multiplication results for numbers from `0` to `max`.

### Summary:
- The program prints a formatted multiplication table.
- The outer loop (`i`) controls the rows, while the inner loop (`j`) controls the columns.
- It calculates the product `i * j` for each cell in the table and prints it with a fixed width of 5 characters for alignment.
