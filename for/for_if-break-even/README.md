### Explanation of the Code:

This Go program uses a simple `for` loop and `if` statements to interact with the user and break the loop based on the user's input. The program will repeatedly ask for an input until the user enters the value `"0"`, at which point it will exit the loop.

### **Code Breakdown**:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Variable to store the input
	znak := ""
	// Infinite loop
	for true {
		// Print a message asking for user input
		fmt.Println("Hello friend")
		// Read user input into the "znak" variable
		fmt.Scanf("%s", &znak)
		// Check if the input is "0", if so, break the loop
		if znak == "0" {
			break
		}
	}
}
```

### **Step-by-step Explanation**:

1. **Variable Declaration**:
   ```go
   znak := ""
   ```
   - This line declares a string variable `znak`, which will be used to store user input. Initially, it's set to an empty string.

2. **Infinite Loop**:
   ```go
   for true {
   ```
   - The `for true` loop will run infinitely, meaning it will continue until explicitly stopped with a `break` statement.

3. **User Input Prompt**:
   ```go
   fmt.Println("Hello friend")
   ```
   - This line prints `"Hello friend"` to the console each time the loop executes, prompting the user for input.

4. **Reading Input**:
   ```go
   fmt.Scanf("%s", &znak)
   ```
   - The `fmt.Scanf("%s", &znak)` reads a string input from the user and stores it in the variable `znak`.

5. **Check for Termination Condition**:
   ```go
   if znak == "0" {
       break
   }
   ```
   - This condition checks if the value of `znak` is `"0"`. If it is, the loop will stop because of the `break` statement, and the program will exit the loop.

6. **Loop Continuation**:
   - If the user does **not** enter `"0"`, the program will go back to asking `"Hello friend"` and await new input.

---

### **Key Concepts**:

1. **Infinite Loop**: The loop will run indefinitely until the user enters `"0"`.
2. **User Input with `fmt.Scanf`**: This function is used to read user input. It expects the format string (`"%s"` for a string input) and stores the result in the provided variable (`&znak`).
3. **Breaking the Loop**: The `break` statement terminates the loop early if a specific condition is met, in this case, if the user inputs `"0"`.

---

### **Summary**:

This Go program asks the user for input in an infinite loop, displaying `"Hello friend"` as a prompt each time. If the user enters `"0"`, the loop terminates and the program exits. This structure could be expanded to handle additional logic based on user input, such as counting even and odd numbers in a range, though this part of the functionality is not yet implemented in the given code.
