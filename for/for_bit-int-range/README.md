Let's break down the code step by step:

### 1. **Printing ASCII Characters**

```go
for i := 0; i < 128; i++ {
    fmt.Printf("%q ", i)
}
```

- This loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = 127` (i.e., 128 iterations).
- The `%q` format verb in the `fmt.Printf` function is used to print the character corresponding to the Unicode value (in this case, the ASCII value of `i`).
- For each value of `i`, the program prints the character it represents in the ASCII table, followed by a space.
  
  **Example Output:**
  ```
  ' ' '!' '"' '#' '$' '%' '&' ''' '(' ')' '*' '+' ',' '-' '.' '/' '0' '1' '2' '3' '4' '5' '6' '7' '8' '9' ':' ';' '<' '=' '>' '?' '@' 'A' 'B' 'C' 'D' 'E' 'F' 'G' 'H' 'I' 'J' 'K' 'L' 'M' 'N' 'O' 'P' 'Q' 'R' 'S' 'T' 'U' 'V' 'W' 'X' 'Y' 'Z' '[' '\\' ']' '^' '_' '`' 'a' 'b' 'c' 'd' 'e' 'f' 'g' 'h' 'i' 'j' 'k' 'l' 'm' 'n' 'o' 'p' 'q' 'r' 's' 't' 'u' 'v' 'w' 'x' 'y' 'z' '{' '|' '}' '~' 
  ```
  This prints the characters for all ASCII codes between 0 and 127.

### 2. **Rune Explanation**

```go
// rune is alias of int32
// because UTF-8 uses 1~4 bytes (8~32 bits)
fmt.Println("rune is alias of int32")
var xr []rune = []rune{'a', 'b', 'c'}
for _, r := range xr {
    fmt.Printf("%q\t%v\n", r, r)
}
```

- **Rune is an alias of `int32`**:
  - In Go, a **rune** is an alias for `int32`. A rune represents a Unicode code point, which is a number that identifies a character in the Unicode standard.
  - `rune` uses 4 bytes (32 bits), meaning it can represent a large range of characters (more than 1 million Unicode characters).
  - UTF-8 encoding, which is commonly used in Go, can use 1 to 4 bytes to encode a single character. This means that Unicode characters might require more than one byte depending on the character.

- The array `xr` contains three characters: `'a'`, `'b'`, and `'c'`. 
  - These characters are stored as **runes** (which internally are of type `int32`).
  - The loop iterates over each character (`r`), and the `fmt.Printf` function prints both the **quoted character** (`%q`) and the **rune value** (`%v`).

### 3. **Output of the Rune Loop**

The `fmt.Printf("%q\t%v\n", r, r)` prints two values for each rune:

- `%q`: This prints the character as a **quoted string**.
- `%v`: This prints the value of the rune, which is the Unicode code point number (an integer).

#### Example Output for the loop:
```
'a'    97
'b'    98
'c'    99
```

Here:
- `'a'` is the character with Unicode code point 97.
- `'b'` is the character with Unicode code point 98.
- `'c'` is the character with Unicode code point 99.

### **Summary of Key Concepts**

1. **ASCII Characters**:
   - The first loop prints all characters with ASCII values from 0 to 127.
   - The `%q` format specifier in Go prints characters in quotes, useful for displaying printable characters and symbols.

2. **Rune and `int32`**:
   - A **rune** in Go is an alias for `int32`, used to represent a Unicode code point.
   - UTF-8 encoding in Go can use 1 to 4 bytes to represent a character, and `rune` can hold any Unicode code point.

3. **Looping through a slice of runes**:
   - A slice of runes is created with `[]rune{'a', 'b', 'c'}`.
   - The loop prints each rune's character and its corresponding Unicode value.

4. **Unicode and UTF-8**:
   - Unicode is a standard that allows every character in any language to be represented by a unique number.
   - UTF-8 encoding is variable-length, using 1 to 4 bytes per character, which allows efficient storage of characters.
