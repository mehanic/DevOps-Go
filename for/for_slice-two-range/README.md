Let's break down the code step by step:

### Code Breakdown:
```go
package main

func main() {
    // Step 1: Declare arrays (slices) arr1 and arr2
    arr1 := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
    arr2 := []int{4, 5, 6, 7}
    
    // Step 2: Create a 2D slice arr3 that holds arr1 and arr2
    arr3 := [][]int{arr1, arr2}
    
    // Step 3: Iterate over arr3 (a slice of slices)
    for _, v := range arr3 {
        // Step 4: Iterate over each slice inside arr3 (arr1 and arr2)
        for _, k := range v {
            // Step 5: Print each element inside each slice
            println(k)
        }
    }
}
```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Declare `arr1` and `arr2`:**
   ```go
   arr1 := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
   arr2 := []int{4, 5, 6, 7}
   ```
   - `arr1` is a slice of integers with values `{1, 2, 3, 4}`.
   - `arr2` is another slice of integers with values `{4, 5, 6, 7}`.

2. **Create a 2D Slice `arr3`:**
   ```go
   arr3 := [][]int{arr1, arr2}
   ```
   - `arr3` is a slice of slices (`[][]int`), containing `arr1` and `arr2`.
   - So, `arr3` is a 2D slice, which looks like this:
     ```
     arr3 = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [4, 5, 6, 7]]
     ```

3. **Iterate Over `arr3`:**
   ```go
   for _, v := range arr3 {
       // inner loop here
   }
   ```
   - The `for _, v := range arr3` loop iterates over `arr3`. Here, `v` will be each individual slice (either `arr1` or `arr2`) from the 2D slice `arr3`.
   - The underscore `_` is used because we are not interested in the index of the slice, just the slice itself (`v`).

4. **Iterate Over Elements Inside Each Slice (`v`):**
   ```go
   for _, k := range v {
       println(k)
   }
   ```
   - Inside the second `for` loop, `v` represents one slice at a time (either `arr1` or `arr2`).
   - The loop `for _, k := range v` iterates over each element inside that slice, where `k` is each individual integer in that slice.
   - The `println(k)` function prints each element in the slice.

### Final Output:

- First, `v` will be `arr1` (i.e., `{1, 2, 3, 4}`), and the inner loop will print:
  ```
  1
  2
  3
  4
  ```

- Then, `v` will be `arr2` (i.e., `{4, 5, 6, 7}`), and the inner loop will print:
  ```
  4
  5
  6
  7
  ```

### Complete Output:
```
1
2
3
4
4
5
6
7
```

### Summary:

- The program declares two 1D slices (`arr1` and `arr2`), and then creates a 2D slice `arr3` that contains these two slices.
- It then uses a nested loop to iterate over the 2D slice (`arr3`) and print all the values from both `arr1` and `arr2`.
- The outer loop goes over each slice inside the 2D slice, and the inner loop prints the individual elements of each slice.
