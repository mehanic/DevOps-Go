This Go program calculates the average of a list of floating-point numbers stored in a text file named `data.txt`. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

### **1. Importing Required Packages**

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"github.com/romzasandysman/datafile"
)
```

- **`fmt`**: This is the standard library package used for formatting and printing output to the console.
- **`log`**: This package is used to log errors. It prints messages to the console, and in this case, it's used to log errors when reading the file.
- **`github.com/romzasandysman/datafile`**: This is an external package that contains a function `GetFloats`. The program assumes that this function is used to read floating-point numbers from a file (`data.txt`).

### **2. Reading Numbers from a File**

```go
numbers, err := datafile.GetFloats("data.txt")

if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
```

- `datafile.GetFloats("data.txt")` reads floating-point numbers from the file `data.txt` and returns a slice of `float64` values. It also returns an `err` value, which is an error object that will be `nil` if the operation is successful, or an error message if something goes wrong.
- If there is an error (e.g., if the file doesn't exist or the content is invalid), the program will terminate, and the error message will be logged using `log.Fatal(err)`.

### **3. Initializing the Sum Variable**

```go
var sum float64 = 0
```

- This line initializes a variable `sum` with a value of `0`. It will be used to accumulate the sum of all the numbers read from the file.

### **4. Summing the Numbers**

```go
for _, number := range numbers {
	sum += number
}
```

- This `for` loop iterates over the slice `numbers`. The `range` keyword is used to loop through the elements of the slice. For each number, the program adds it to the `sum` variable.
- **`_`**: The blank identifier `_` is used here to discard the index of each number since we only care about the value of the numbers.

### **5. Calculating the Average**

```go
simpleCount := float64(len(numbers))
fmt.Printf("Average: %0.2f\n", sum/simpleCount)
```

- **`len(numbers)`**: This function call returns the length of the `numbers` slice, which represents how many numbers are in the file.
- **`float64(len(numbers))`**: The length is converted to `float64` to ensure that the division results in a floating-point number rather than an integer (since `sum` is of type `float64`).
- **`sum / simpleCount`**: The program divides the sum of all numbers by the total count of numbers to calculate the average.
- `fmt.Printf("Average: %0.2f\n", sum/simpleCount)` prints the result to the console with 2 decimal places.

### **Full Flow of the Program:**

1. **Read numbers** from the file `data.txt`.
2. **Sum up** the numbers.
3. **Calculate** the average by dividing the sum by the number of values.
4. **Print** the average to the console with two decimal points.

### **Assumptions:**
- The file `data.txt` should contain floating-point numbers, likely one per line or separated by whitespace.
- If the file cannot be read (e.g., file doesn't exist, or the data is in an incorrect format), the program will log an error and exit.

### **Example Scenario:**

Assume the content of `data.txt` is:
```
2.5
3.0
4.5
1.0
```

- The program will read these numbers into a slice: `[2.5, 3.0, 4.5, 1.0]`.
- The sum of these numbers is `2.5 + 3.0 + 4.5 + 1.0 = 11.0`.
- The average is calculated as `11.0 / 4 = 2.75`.
- The program will print:
  ```
  Average: 2.75
  ```

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Error Handling:** The program ensures that if any error occurs while reading the file, it stops execution and logs the error message.
2. **External Package Usage:** The program uses the `datafile` package (assumed to be a custom or external package) to simplify reading the file's content.
3. **Sum and Average Calculation:** It performs basic arithmetic operations to calculate the sum and average of a series of numbers.
4. **Formatting Output:** The average is printed using `fmt.Printf` with a specific format to ensure it has two decimal places.

### **Improvement Ideas:**

- If the `datafile.GetFloats` function cannot handle different formats of numbers (such as commas or mixed data types), additional validation or error checking could be added.
- The program could also check if the file exists and handle scenarios where the file is empty.
