In this Go program, the goal is to iterate over the string `shalom` and print each character in the string. Let's break it down step by step:

### Code Breakdown:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	shalom := "shalom"

	for i := 0; i < len(shalom); i++ {
		c := shalom[i]
		fmt.Printf("%c\n", c)
	}
}
```

### 1. **Declaring the String:**
```go
shalom := "shalom"
```
- Here, a variable `shalom` is declared and initialized with the string `"shalom"`. The string `shalom` consists of the following characters: `s`, `h`, `a`, `l`, `o`, `m`.

### 2. **For Loop to Iterate Over the String:**
```go
for i := 0; i < len(shalom); i++ {
    c := shalom[i]
    fmt.Printf("%c\n", c)
}
```
This is the loop where the string `shalom` is iterated through. Let's break it down:
- `for i := 0; i < len(shalom); i++`: This `for` loop starts with `i = 0` and continues as long as `i` is less than the length of the string `shalom`. The length of the string `shalom` is 6 (because it has 6 characters: `s`, `h`, `a`, `l`, `o`, `m`). On each iteration, `i` increments by 1.
  - `i` represents the index of the current character in the string `shalom`.
  
- Inside the loop:
  ```go
  c := shalom[i]
  ```
  - This line accesses the character at index `i` in the string `shalom` using the `shalom[i]` notation. 
  - `c` is a variable that holds the byte value of the character at position `i` in the string. Since Go strings are stored as a sequence of bytes (not characters), the `shalom[i]` expression returns the **byte** (ASCII value) corresponding to the character at that position in the string.

- Next, the `fmt.Printf("%c\n", c)` function is used to print the character:
  ```go
  fmt.Printf("%c\n", c)
  ```
  - The `%c` format specifier is used to print the character corresponding to the byte `c`.
  - `\n` is a newline character, ensuring that each character is printed on a new line.

### Output Explanation:
For the string `"shalom"`, the loop iterates 6 times (since the string has 6 characters). The ASCII values of each character are:
- `s` -> ASCII value `115`
- `h` -> ASCII value `104`
- `a` -> ASCII value `97`
- `l` -> ASCII value `108`
- `o` -> ASCII value `111`
- `m` -> ASCII value `109`

Each character is printed one by one on a new line. So the output will be:

```
s
h
a
l
o
m
```

### Summary:
- The program iterates through the string `shalom` using a `for` loop.
- In each iteration, it extracts a character from the string and prints it using `fmt.Printf("%c\n", c)`.
- The `%c` format specifier ensures that the byte (character) value is printed as a character.
