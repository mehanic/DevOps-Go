Let's break down this Go program and explain each part in detail:

### Overview:
This program generates a random slice of integers, checks if specific numbers from another slice exist in the randomly generated slice, and then prints whether each number is found or not.

---

### Code Explanation:

#### 1. **Importing Necessary Packages**:

```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)
```

- **`fmt`**: This package is used to handle formatted input and output. Here, it is used for printing results to the console.
- **`math/rand`**: This package is used to generate pseudo-random numbers.
- **`time`**: This package is used to get the current time, which is used as a seed for the random number generator.

#### 2. **Setting Up the Random Number Generator**:

```go
rand.Seed(time.Now().UTC().UnixNano())
```

- **`rand.Seed()`**: Initializes the random number generator with a seed. Using the current time (`time.Now().UTC().UnixNano()`) ensures that each time the program runs, different random numbers are generated.

#### 3. **Initializing the Arrays**:

```go
n := 5
a := []int{}
b := []int{3, 4, 5}
```

- **`n := 5`**: This defines the number of elements to be generated in the first slice `a`. In this case, it will generate 5 random numbers.
- **`a := []int{}`**: Initializes an empty slice `a` to store the random integers.
- **`b := []int{3, 4, 5}`**: Defines the second slice `b` which contains the numbers to search for in `a`.

#### 4. **Generating Random Numbers**:

```go
for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
	k := rand.Intn(20)
	a = append(a, k)
}
fmt.Println(a)
```

- **`for i := 0; i < n; i++`**: A loop that runs `n` times (in this case, 5 times) to generate random numbers.
- **`k := rand.Intn(20)`**: Generates a random number between `0` and `19` (inclusive).
- **`a = append(a, k)`**: Appends each random number `k` to the slice `a`.
- **`fmt.Println(a)`**: Prints the random slice `a` after it is generated.

#### 5. **Searching for Specific Numbers in `a`**:

```go
for i := 0; i < len(b); i++ {
	find := b[i]
	isExist := false
	for _, v := range a {
		if find == v {
			isExist = true
			break
		}
	}
	if isExist {
		fmt.Printf("find number %d in slice\n", find)
	} else {
		fmt.Printf("not find number %d in slice\n", find)
	}
}
```

- **`for i := 0; i < len(b); i++`**: This loop iterates through each element in slice `b`. The length of `b` is `3`, so the loop will run 3 times (once for each of `3`, `4`, and `5`).
- **`find := b[i]`**: The variable `find` is set to the current element of `b` (i.e., `3`, `4`, or `5`).
- **`isExist := false`**: A boolean variable `isExist` is initialized to `false`, which will track whether the number `find` exists in slice `a`.
- **Inner `for` loop**: This loop iterates through each element of slice `a` to check if any value in `a` is equal to `find`. 
  - If a match is found (`if find == v`), `isExist` is set to `true`, and the loop breaks early to avoid unnecessary further checking.
- **`if isExist`**: After checking all elements of `a`, the program prints whether the number was found in `a`:
  - If `isExist` is `true`, it prints that the number is found.
  - If `isExist` is `false`, it prints that the number is not found.

### Example:

If the random numbers generated for `a` are `[10, 2, 3, 18, 14]`, and the numbers we are looking for are `3`, `4`, and `5`, the output would look like this:

```
[10 2 3 18 14]
find number 3 in slice
not find number 4 in slice
not find number 5 in slice
```

If the random numbers generated were `[5, 3, 1, 7, 12]`, the output would be:

```
[5 3 1 7 12]
find number 3 in slice
not find number 4 in slice
not find number 5 in slice
```

### Key Points:
- **Random Number Generation**: `rand.Seed(time.Now().UTC().UnixNano())` is used to seed the random number generator with the current time, ensuring that random numbers are different each time the program runs.
- **Searching for Elements**: The program checks if elements from slice `b` (i.e., `3`, `4`, `5`) exist in slice `a`. The inner `for` loop compares each element of `a` with the current element of `b`.
- **Use of Boolean Flag (`isExist`)**: This flag helps track whether the searched number exists in the slice `a`. If it exists, a message is printed; otherwise, a different message is shown.

### Final Thoughts:
This program is a good example of how to generate random data, search for specific elements, and provide feedback to the user based on whether those elements are found or not in Go.
