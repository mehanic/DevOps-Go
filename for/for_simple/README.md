In this Go program, the task is to print all numbers from 0 to 100 that are divisible by 4. There are two methods provided in the code, and we'll explain both:

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Original Code (commented-out)**:
   ```go
   for i := 0; i <= 100; i++ {
       if i%4 == 0 {
           fmt.Print(i, " ")
       }
   }
   ```
   - This loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 100` with an increment of 1 (`i++`).
   - Inside the loop, there is an `if` condition: `if i%4 == 0`. This checks if the current number (`i`) is divisible by 4 without a remainder. The `%` operator is the **modulus operator**, which gives the remainder of a division. If the remainder is `0`, the number is divisible by 4.
   - If the condition is true, the program prints the value of `i`.

   **How this works**:
   - The loop iterates over each number from 0 to 100.
   - For each number, it checks if the number is divisible by 4 (i.e., if the remainder of dividing the number by 4 is 0).
   - When the number is divisible by 4, it is printed.

2. **Optimized Code (uncommented)**:
   ```go
   for i := 0; i <= 100; i += 4 {
       fmt.Println(i)
   }
   ```
   - This is a more **optimized** version of the loop.
   - The loop starts at `i = 0` and runs until `i <= 100`. However, instead of incrementing `i` by 1 (like in the original code), it increments by `4` (`i += 4`).
   - This means the loop only considers numbers that are divisible by 4.
   
   **How this works**:
   - The loop starts at `0`, and in each iteration, it adds 4 to the value of `i`.
   - This ensures that the only numbers the loop considers are those that are divisible by 4: `0, 4, 8, 12, 16, ..., 100`.
   - There's no need for an `if` condition to check divisibility since we're already only iterating through numbers that are multiples of 4.

### Comparison of the Two Methods:

1. **First Method (commented-out)**: 
   - It checks each number in the range from `0` to `100` to see if it's divisible by 4 using the modulus operator (`i % 4 == 0`).
   - This method will check all numbers in the range, even those that aren't divisible by 4, and only print the ones that pass the divisibility test.

2. **Second Method (uncommented)**:
   - It directly increments `i` by 4, which means it only considers numbers that are divisible by 4, avoiding the need for a divisibility check in each iteration.
   - This method is **more efficient** because it skips over numbers that aren't divisible by 4, reducing the number of iterations.

### Example Output for Both Methods:
- Both methods will print the same output:
  ```
  0
  4
  8
  12
  16
  20
  24
  28
  32
  36
  40
  44
  48
  52
  56
  60
  64
  68
  72
  76
  80
  84
  88
  92
  96
  100
  ```

### Conclusion:
- The second method (with `i += 4`) is more **efficient** as it directly generates numbers that are divisible by 4, avoiding the extra check and making fewer iterations.
- The first method (using `i++` and checking with `i%4 == 0`) is less efficient as it checks every number from `0` to `100` even if it's not divisible by 4.
