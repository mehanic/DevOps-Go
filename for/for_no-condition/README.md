This Go program demonstrates the use of an **infinite loop**. Here's a detailed explanation of the rules:

### Code Breakdown:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// this is an infinite loop
	i := 0
	for {
		fmt.Println(i)
		i++
	}
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Package Declaration**:
   - `package main`: This indicates that the code is part of the `main` package. The `main` function is the entry point of the program, meaning that this is an executable program.

2. **Importing the `fmt` package**:
   - `import "fmt"`: The `fmt` package is imported to enable formatted input and output functions, such as `fmt.Println()`, which is used to print data to the console.

3. **Main Function**:
   - `func main() { ... }`: The `main` function is the starting point for execution. When you run the program, the code inside this function is executed.

4. **Variable Declaration**:
   - `i := 0`: This initializes the variable `i` to `0`. This variable will be used as a counter to track the number that is being printed in each iteration of the loop.

5. **Infinite Loop**:
   - `for { ... }`: This is a `for` loop without any condition or post-action (increment, etc.), which means it will run indefinitely.
     - In a typical `for` loop, you would have the structure `for initialization; condition; post-action { ... }`. However, if you omit the condition entirely (like in this case), the loop will **continue forever** unless explicitly stopped by some break or return statement. This creates an **infinite loop**.
   
6. **Loop Body**:
   - `fmt.Println(i)`: Inside the loop body, this line prints the value of `i` to the console.
   - `i++`: This increments the value of `i` by 1 on each iteration. So, on each pass of the loop, the value of `i` will increase by 1 and be printed again.

### What Happens During Execution:

- Initially, `i = 0`. The loop will print `0` on the first iteration.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1 (`i++`), so `i` becomes `1`, and the loop continues.
- The loop will keep incrementing `i` and printing the current value of `i` without ever stopping. It will keep printing `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and so on, indefinitely.

### Infinite Loop:

- Since there is **no condition to stop** the loop, this program will run forever, continuously printing the increasing value of `i`.
  
**Important to note:**
- In real-world programs, infinite loops like this should usually be avoided unless there's a clear stopping condition or an intentional wait (e.g., in server programs or background tasks).
- To stop this program manually, you would have to interrupt it using `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where it is running.

### Example Output:

```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
...
```

It will continue printing numbers indefinitely.

### Summary:

- **Infinite Loop**: A loop without a stopping condition that runs endlessly.
- **Variable `i`**: This is a counter variable that starts at 0 and is incremented by 1 after each iteration.
- The program will **print increasing numbers** continuously, from 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., and will never stop unless manually interrupted.
