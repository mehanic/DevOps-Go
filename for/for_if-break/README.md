### Explanation of the Code:

This Go program uses a `for` loop to print numbers from `0` to `4` and then exits the loop when the number `5` is encountered due to the `break` statement.

---

### **Code Breakdown**:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	for i := 0; i <= 10; i++ {  // Loop from 0 to 10
		if i == 5 {  // Check if i equals 5
			break  // Exit the loop if i equals 5
		}
		fmt.Println(i)  // Print the value of i
	}
}
```

### **Step-by-step Explanation**:

1. **The `for` loop**:
   ```go
   for i := 0; i <= 10; i++ {
   ```
   - This `for` loop starts by initializing the variable `i` to `0`.
   - The loop runs as long as `i <= 10` (i.e., `i` will increase from `0` to `10`).
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 with each iteration (`i++`).

2. **The `if` statement**:
   ```go
   if i == 5 {
       break
   }
   ```
   - Inside the loop, thereâ€™s an `if` statement that checks if `i == 5`.
   - If `i` is equal to `5`, the `break` statement is executed.

3. **The `break` statement**:
   ```go
   break
   ```
   - The `break` statement causes the loop to immediately exit, regardless of whether the loop condition is still true or not.
   - In this case, when `i == 5`, the `break` exits the loop, and no further numbers are printed.

4. **The `fmt.Println(i)`**:
   ```go
   fmt.Println(i)
   ```
   - This prints the value of `i` to the console during each iteration of the loop, **but only until `i` equals `5`**.
   - Once `i == 5`, the loop breaks, and `5` is not printed.

---

### **Flow of the Program**:

- The loop starts with `i = 0` and prints `0`.
- In the next iterations, it prints `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`.
- When `i == 5`, the `if` condition `i == 5` is true, and the `break` statement is executed.
- The loop terminates immediately, and the program does not print `5` or any numbers after that.

### **Output**:

```
0
1
2
3
4
```

- The program prints the numbers from `0` to `4` and stops before printing `5` because of the `break` statement.

---

### **Key Points**:

- **`for` loop**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 10`, but it exits earlier due to the `break` statement.
- **`break` statement**: When `i == 5`, the `break` statement is triggered, causing an immediate exit from the loop.
- **Condition-based termination**: The program terminates the loop when a specific condition is met (`i == 5` in this case).

This is a simple example of using a `for` loop combined with a `break` statement to control the flow of the loop and terminate early.
