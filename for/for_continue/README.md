This Go program demonstrates the use of the **`continue`** statement inside a **`for`** loop. Let's break down the code step by step:

### Code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// continue will skip the rest of the current iteration and go to the next one
	i := 0
	for {
		i++
		if i%2 == 0 {
			continue
		}
		fmt.Println(i)
		if i >= 50 {
			break
		}
	}
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization of the variable `i`**:
   ```go
   i := 0
   ```
   - A variable `i` is declared and initialized to `0`. This will be the counter used in the loop.

2. **`for` loop with an infinite condition**:
   ```go
   for {
       // Loop runs indefinitely until a `break` is encountered
   }
   ```
   - This is an infinite `for` loop, which will run indefinitely unless interrupted by a `break` statement or another condition that stops it.
   
3. **Incrementing `i`**:
   ```go
   i++
   ```
   - In each iteration of the loop, the value of `i` is incremented by `1`.

4. **The `continue` statement**:
   ```go
   if i%2 == 0 {
       continue
   }
   ```
   - **`continue`** is used to **skip the current iteration** of the loop and jump to the next iteration.
   - The condition `i%2 == 0` checks if `i` is **even**. If `i` is even, the `continue` statement is triggered, meaning the **remaining code in the loop for this iteration is skipped**.
   - **So, when `i` is even**, the program doesn't print anything and moves to the next iteration.

5. **Printing the odd numbers**:
   ```go
   fmt.Println(i)
   ```
   - If `i` is **odd** (because the `continue` was skipped), the value of `i` is printed.

6. **Breaking the loop when `i` reaches 50**:
   ```go
   if i >= 50 {
       break
   }
   ```
   - After printing the odd number, the condition `i >= 50` checks if `i` has reached or surpassed 50.
   - If `i` is **greater than or equal to 50**, the `break` statement will terminate the loop, and the program will exit the loop.

### **How the program works**:
- The loop starts with `i = 0`. In the first iteration:
  - `i` is incremented to 1.
  - Since 1 is odd, it is printed.
  - Then, the loop checks if `i` has reached 50, but it hasn't, so it continues to the next iteration.

- In the next iteration, `i` becomes 2. Since 2 is even, the `continue` statement is triggered, and the print statement is skipped. The loop moves to the next iteration without printing anything.

- This process continues, with **only odd numbers being printed** because every time `i` is even, the `continue` statement skips the printing.

- The loop continues until `i` reaches 51, at which point the `break` statement stops the loop.

### **Output**:

The output will be the odd numbers from 1 to 49 (since the loop stops when `i` reaches 50 and doesn't print it):

```
1
3
5
7
9
11
13
15
17
19
21
23
25
27
29
31
33
35
37
39
41
43
45
47
49
```

### Key Takeaways:

1. **`continue`**: Skips the rest of the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.
2. **Odd numbers**: The program prints only odd numbers between 1 and 49 because even numbers are skipped due to the `continue` statement.
3. **`break`**: Exits the loop when `i` reaches 50, terminating the loop execution.

This demonstrates how to use the `continue` statement effectively to skip specific conditions in a loop and how to control loop flow with `break`.
