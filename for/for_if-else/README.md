### Explanation of the Code:

This Go program demonstrates the use of a `for` loop combined with an `if-else` statement to print messages based on the value of the `counter` variable.

---

### **Code Breakdown**:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Start a for loop that runs 10 times (counter ranges from 0 to 9)
	for counter := 0; counter < 10; counter++ {
		// Check if the current counter value is less than 5
		if counter < 5 {
			// If counter is less than 5, print "Hello"
			fmt.Println("Hello")
		} else {
			// Otherwise, print "World"
			fmt.Println("World")
		}
	}
}
```

### **Step-by-step Explanation**:

1. **`for` Loop**:
   ```go
   for counter := 0; counter < 10; counter++ {
   ```
   - This is a `for` loop that initializes the `counter` variable to `0` and runs the loop while `counter` is less than `10`.
   - The loop increments the `counter` by `1` each time (`counter++`).
   - This means the loop will execute 10 times, with `counter` values ranging from `0` to `9`.

2. **`if-else` Statement**:
   ```go
   if counter < 5 {
       fmt.Println("Hello")
   } else {
       fmt.Println("World")
   }
   ```
   - Inside the loop, an `if-else` statement checks if `counter` is less than `5`.
   - If `counter` is less than `5` (i.e., `counter` ranges from `0` to `4`), it prints `"Hello"`.
   - If `counter` is `5` or greater (i.e., `counter` ranges from `5` to `9`), it prints `"World"`.

3. **Output**:
   - The loop will execute 10 times, and the output will alternate between `"Hello"` and `"World"` based on the value of `counter`.

### **Output**:

The program will print the following:

```
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
World
World
World
World
World
```

- **First 5 iterations** (`counter` values 0 to 4): The condition `counter < 5` is true, so it prints `"Hello"` for each of these values.
- **Next 5 iterations** (`counter` values 5 to 9): The condition `counter < 5` is false, so it prints `"World"` for each of these values.

---

### **Key Concepts**:

1. **`for` loop**: This loop executes a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of iterations (in this case, 10 times).
2. **`if-else` statement**: This is used to execute different code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false.
   - **If Condition**: If `counter` is less than 5, it prints `"Hello"`.
   - **Else Condition**: If `counter` is 5 or more, it prints `"World"`.

---

### **Summary**:

This program uses a `for` loop to iterate 10 times, and depending on the value of `counter`, it prints `"Hello"` when the counter is less than 5 and `"World"` when the counter is 5 or greater. The logic is implemented using a simple `if-else` condition inside the loop.
