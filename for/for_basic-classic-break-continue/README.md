This Go program demonstrates various types of loops that are used to control program flow by repeating blocks of code. Let's break down each part of the program and explain the loop rules and usage:

### **1. Basic `for` Loop with a Single Condition:**
```go
i := 1
for i <= 3 {
    fmt.Println(i)
    i = i + 1
}
```

#### Explanation:
- The loop starts with the initialization of `i := 1`.
- The loop runs while the condition `i <= 3` is true.
- Inside the loop:
  - It prints the current value of `i`.
  - It then increments `i` by 1 (`i = i + 1`).
- When `i` reaches 4, the condition `i <= 3` becomes false, and the loop stops.

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
```

#### Key Points:
- This is a **basic for loop** in Go, where the condition is checked before each iteration.
- It allows for manual control over the loop counter (like `i` in this case).
- It is equivalent to a `while` loop in some other programming languages.

### **2. Classic `for` Loop with Initialization, Condition, and After Statement:**
```go
for j := 7; j <= 9; j++ {
    fmt.Println(j)
}
```

#### Explanation:
- This is the classic `for` loop, with three parts:
  - **Initialization**: `j := 7` sets the loop variable `j` to 7 at the start.
  - **Condition**: `j <= 9` checks if `j` is less than or equal to 9 before each iteration.
  - **After**: `j++` increments `j` by 1 after each iteration.
- The loop will print the values of `j` from 7 to 9.

**Output:**
```
7
8
9
```

#### Key Points:
- This loop follows the standard format of a `for` loop: initialization, condition, and after action.
- It's a compact and common loop structure in Go and many other languages.

### **3. Infinite `for` Loop with `break`:**
```go
for {
    fmt.Println("loop")
    break
}
```

#### Explanation:
- This loop has **no condition** specified, meaning it would theoretically run infinitely.
- However, the loop is immediately **broken** using the `break` statement after the first iteration.
- So, it prints "loop" once, and then the loop exits due to `break`.

**Output:**
```
loop
```

#### Key Points:
- In Go, a `for` loop without a condition will **run indefinitely** (like a `while(true)` loop in some other languages).
- You can use `break` to exit the loop early if needed.
- This type of loop is useful when you want to run the loop until a certain condition or event happens, but don't want to define the loop condition upfront.

---

### **4. `for` Loop with `continue`:**
```go
for n := 0; n <= 5; n++ {
    if n%2 == 0 {
        continue
    }
    fmt.Println(n)
}
```

#### Explanation:
- This loop runs for `n` from 0 to 5.
- Inside the loop, there's an `if` condition to check if `n` is an even number (`n%2 == 0`).
- If the condition is true (i.e., `n` is even), the `continue` statement is executed.
  - The `continue` statement skips the remaining code in the loop body and moves to the next iteration.
- If `n` is odd, it will print the value of `n`.

**Output:**
```
1
3
5
```

#### Key Points:
- `continue` skips the current iteration and proceeds with the next iteration of the loop.
- In this case, it skips the print statement when `n` is even, so only odd numbers (1, 3, 5) are printed.
- This is useful when you want to bypass certain logic or steps under specific conditions.

---

### **Summary of Rules:**

1. **Basic `for` loop with a condition**: You can loop using a condition before each iteration (like `i <= 3`), and manually modify the loop variable (like `i = i + 1`).

2. **Classic `for` loop**: The typical `for` loop structure in Go with initialization, condition, and after-action (`j := 7; j <= 9; j++`).

3. **Infinite loop with `for`**: A loop without a condition runs indefinitely, and can be exited using `break`.

4. **Using `continue`**: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration, useful for avoiding specific conditions.

These loops provide flexibility in how you control the flow of your program and manage repeated execution of code blocks in Go.
