Let's break down and explain the rules and logic behind the provided Go code:

### Code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	//цикл -> итерация(шаг,step)
	//i++  -> i = i + 1 (i-> счетчик)
	//i<5 -> условие работы цикла
	//for счетчик; условие; шаг { действия}
	for i := 1; i < 5; i++ {
		//действие1
		fmt.Println("start step")
		//действие2
		fmt.Println("gooo")
		//действие3
		fmt.Println("end step")
		fmt.Println("")
	}
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **`package main`**:
   - This defines the package name as `main`, which indicates that this is an executable program (as opposed to a library). The `main` function in this package is the entry point of the program.

2. **`import "fmt"`**:
   - The `import` statement is used to include the `fmt` package, which provides functions for formatted I/O, such as `fmt.Println()`, which is used here to print output to the console.

3. **The `for` loop:**
   - The `for` loop is used to execute a block of code repeatedly for a certain number of iterations. In Go, the `for` loop has three main components: **initialization**, **condition**, and **post-operation**.
   
   **Syntax**: 
   ```go
   for initialization; condition; post-operation {
       // code to execute in each iteration
   }
   ```
   Let's break down the `for` loop in this code:

   **Initialization:**
   - `i := 1`: This initializes the loop variable `i` to `1`. The loop counter is set to 1 at the beginning.

   **Condition:**
   - `i < 5`: This is the condition that must be `true` for the loop to continue. As long as `i` is less than `5`, the loop will run.
   
   **Post-operation:**
   - `i++`: This increments the value of `i` by `1` after each iteration of the loop. It is shorthand for `i = i + 1`.

   **Loop Body:**
   Inside the loop body, we have three actions that will execute during each iteration:

   - `fmt.Println("start step")`: This will print `"start step"` at the beginning of each iteration.
   - `fmt.Println("gooo")`: This will print `"gooo"` during each iteration.
   - `fmt.Println("end step")`: This will print `"end step"` at the end of each iteration.
   - `fmt.Println("")`: This adds a blank line for better readability between each iteration's output.

### **Loop Behavior**:

- The loop begins with `i = 1`.
- In each iteration, the loop will print the three statements (`start step`, `gooo`, and `end step`), followed by an empty line.
- After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 (`i++`).
- The loop continues until `i` reaches `5`. When `i = 5`, the condition `i < 5` will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate.

### **Iteration Breakdown**:

- **First Iteration (`i = 1`)**:
  ```
  start step
  gooo
  end step
  (empty line)
  ```

- **Second Iteration (`i = 2`)**:
  ```
  start step
  gooo
  end step
  (empty line)
  ```

- **Third Iteration (`i = 3`)**:
  ```
  start step
  gooo
  end step
  (empty line)
  ```

- **Fourth Iteration (`i = 4`)**:
  ```
  start step
  gooo
  end step
  (empty line)
  ```

- **Termination:**
  - After the fourth iteration, `i` becomes `5`, and the condition `i < 5` is no longer true. The loop terminates.

### **Summary of the Loop**:

- The `for` loop starts with `i = 1` and runs until `i` reaches `5`.
- In each iteration, it prints three lines (`"start step"`, `"gooo"`, and `"end step"`) followed by an empty line.
- The loop increments `i` by 1 after each iteration (`i++`), and when `i` reaches `5`, the loop exits.

### **Final Output**:
The output printed by this program will be:

```
start step
gooo
end step

start step
gooo
end step

start step
gooo
end step

start step
gooo
end step
```

### **Key Concepts**:

- **Loop Initialization**: Setting the loop variable at the start (`i := 1`).
- **Condition**: The loop will continue running as long as the condition is true (`i < 5`).
- **Incrementing the Counter**: The counter (`i`) is incremented after each iteration (`i++`).
- **Loop Execution**: The block of code inside the loop is executed repeatedly for each value of `i` from 1 to 4.
