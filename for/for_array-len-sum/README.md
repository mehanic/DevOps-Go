Let's break down the Go code step by step:

### **Code Explanation:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	numbers := [...]int{10, 8, 1, 2, 3, 45, 12, 20}  // 1. Define an array of numbers
	n := len(numbers)                             // 2. Get the length of the numbers array
	sumi := 0                                      // 3. Initialize a variable to store the sum
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {                       // 4. Loop through each element in the array
		sumi = sumi + numbers[i]                  // 5. Add each number to the sum
	}
	fmt.Println(sumi / n)                          // 6. Print the average (sum divided by the number of elements)
}
```

### **Step-by-step Breakdown:**

#### 1. **Defining the `numbers` array:**
```go
numbers := [...]int{10, 8, 1, 2, 3, 45, 12, 20}
```
- The `numbers` array is defined with the integers: `[10, 8, 1, 2, 3, 45, 12, 20]`.
- The `[...]` syntax automatically determines the size of the array based on the number of elements provided.

#### 2. **Getting the length of the `numbers` array:**
```go
n := len(numbers)
```
- The `len()` function returns the length of the `numbers` array. 
- In this case, `n` will be `8` because the array has 8 elements.

#### 3. **Initializing the `sumi` variable:**
```go
sumi := 0
```
- The variable `sumi` is initialized to `0`. This will hold the sum of the numbers in the array.

#### 4. **Looping through the `numbers` array:**
```go
for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
```
- A `for` loop is used to iterate through the array. 
- The loop runs from `i = 0` (the first index) to `i = 7` (the last index), covering all elements of the array.

#### 5. **Adding each number to `sumi`:**
```go
sumi = sumi + numbers[i]
```
- Inside the loop, the value of `numbers[i]` (the current element in the array) is added to the `sumi` variable.
- Initially, `sumi` is `0`, so on the first iteration, `numbers[0]` (which is `10`) is added to `sumi`, making `sumi = 10`.
- On the second iteration, `numbers[1]` (which is `8`) is added to `sumi`, making `sumi = 18`, and so on for all elements in the array.

#### 6. **Calculating and printing the average:**
```go
fmt.Println(sumi / n)
```
- After the loop finishes, the sum of all the numbers is stored in `sumi`.
- The program then calculates the **average** of the numbers by dividing the sum (`sumi`) by the number of elements (`n`).
- `sumi` is the total sum of the numbers, and `n` is the number of elements in the array.
  
- The final output will be the average of the elements in the array.

### **Sum Calculation:**

Let's manually calculate the sum of the numbers in the array first:

- `10 + 8 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 45 + 12 + 20 = 101`

Now, calculate the average:

- The length of the array is `8`, so:
- `101 / 8 = 12` (since Go uses integer division when both operands are integers)

Thus, the output will be:
```
12
```

### **Summary:**
- This program calculates the sum of all elements in the `numbers` array, and then calculates and prints the **integer average** by dividing the sum by the number of elements in the array. 
- The sum of the numbers `[10, 8, 1, 2, 3, 45, 12, 20]` is `101`, and the average is `12`.
