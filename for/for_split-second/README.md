Let's break down the program step-by-step and explain how it works:

### Overview:
This program displays a clock using ASCII art. The time is shown in the format `HH:MM:SS.s` (with `s` representing hundredths of a second), and it updates every 0.1 seconds.

### Key Concepts:
1. **ASCII Art Representation of Digits**:
   - Each digit (0-9) is represented as a 5-line ASCII art representation stored in a `placeholder` array of strings.
   - For example, the number `0` is represented by:
     ```
     ███
     █ █
     █ █
     █ █
     ███
     ```

2. **Colon and Dot Representation**:
   - The colon (`:`) and dot (`.`) symbols are represented similarly using the `placeholder` array. The colon (`:`) is used to separate hours, minutes, and seconds, and the dot (`.`) is used for displaying hundredths of a second.

3. **Screen Management**:
   - The `github.com/inancgumus/screen` package is used for screen manipulation, like clearing the screen and moving the cursor to the top left corner, allowing for a real-time updating clock.

### Code Walkthrough:

#### 1. Importing Libraries:
```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
    "github.com/inancgumus/screen"
)
```
- `fmt`: For formatted output (to print ASCII art).
- `time`: To get the current time.
- `screen`: To manipulate the terminal screen (clear it, move the cursor, etc.).

#### 2. Defining `placeholder` Type and Digits:
```go
// placeholder is a type alias for a slice of strings.
// It represents a single digit or symbol in the clock.
type placeholder [5]string
```
- `placeholder` is defined as an array of 5 strings, each string representing a row of the ASCII art for a digit or symbol.

```go
// digits contains the ASCII art representations of the digits 0-9.
var digits = [...]placeholder{
    {"███", "█ █", "█ █", "█ █", "███"}, // 0
    {"  █", "  █", "  █", "  █", "  █"}, // 1
    {"███", "  █", "███", "█  ", "███"}, // 2
    // Other digits go here...
}
```
- `digits` is an array of `placeholder` structs representing the digits 0 to 9 in ASCII art.

```go
// colon and dot represent the ":" and "." symbols, respectively.
var colon = placeholder{"   ", " ░ ", "   ", " ░ ", "   "}
var dot = placeholder{"   ", "   ", "   ", " ░ ", " ░ "}
```
- `colon` and `dot` are `placeholder` variables representing the `:` (colon) and `.` (dot) symbols used in the clock.

#### 3. Main Loop:
```go
func main() {
    screen.Clear()

    for {
        screen.MoveTopLeft()
        now := time.Now()
        hour, min, sec := now.Hour(), now.Minute(), now.Second()
        ssec := now.Nanosecond() / 1e8
```
- `screen.Clear()` clears the terminal screen at the start.
- `for { ... }` starts an infinite loop that continuously updates the time.
- `now := time.Now()` gets the current time.
- `hour, min, sec := now.Hour(), now.Minute(), now.Second()` gets the current hour, minute, and second.
- `ssec := now.Nanosecond() / 1e8` calculates the hundredths of a second (the first digit of the nanosecond value).

#### 4. Building the Clock:
```go
clock := [...]placeholder{
    digits[hour/10], digits[hour%10],
    colon,
    digits[min/10], digits[min%10],
    colon,
    digits[sec/10], digits[sec%10],
    dot,
    digits[ssec],
}
```
- The `clock` is an array of `placeholder` that contains the ASCII art for the time.
- Each digit is selected from the `digits` array using modulo (`%`) and division (`/`) to extract the tens and ones digits of hours, minutes, seconds, and hundredths of a second.

#### 5. Displaying the Clock:
```go
for line := range clock[0] {
    for index, digit := range clock {
        next := clock[index][line]
        if (digit == colon || digit == dot) && sec%2 == 0 {
            next = "   "
        }
        fmt.Print(next, "  ")
    }
    fmt.Println()
}
```
- The outer loop `for line := range clock[0]` iterates over the lines of the ASCII art (there are 5 lines for each digit/symbol).
- The inner loop `for index, digit := range clock` iterates over each digit/symbol in the `clock` array.
- `next := clock[index][line]` retrieves the current line of the current digit or symbol.
- If the symbol is a colon (`:`) or dot (`.`), it will blink by alternating its visibility based on the seconds. If the current second is even, the colon/dot is hidden by setting `next = "   "`.
- `fmt.Print(next, "  ")` prints the ASCII art for each symbol, adding spaces between them for separation.

#### 6. Sleeping Between Updates:
```go
const splitSecond = time.Second / 10
time.Sleep(splitSecond)
```
- The program waits for 0.1 seconds (`splitSecond`) before updating the clock again. This creates the effect of a clock that updates in real-time.

### Output:
This program continuously prints the current time in ASCII art in the format `HH:MM:SS.s` (hours, minutes, seconds, and hundredths of a second). The colon and dot symbols will blink every second.

For example:
```
███   █ █   ███   █ █   ███   █ █
  █   ░    ░    █ █   █ █   █ █
███   ░    ░    █ █   █ █   █ █
█ █   ░    ░    █ █   █ █   █ █
███   ░    ░    █ █   █ █   █ █
```

### Summary:
- This Go program simulates a real-time clock using ASCII art for digits, a colon (`:`), and a dot (`.`).
- The clock updates every 0.1 seconds, and the colon and dot symbols blink.
- The `screen` package is used to clear the terminal and move the cursor, creating the effect of a live clock in the terminal.
