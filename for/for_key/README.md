Let's break down and explain the rules and logic behind the provided Go code step by step:

### Full Code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UTC().UnixNano()) // Initialize random number generator with current Unix timestamp
	n := 5                                // Set the number of random numbers to generate
	a := []int{}                          // Initialize an empty slice of integers

	// Generate 'n' random integers and store them in slice 'a'
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		k := rand.Intn(100) // Generate a random integer between 0 and 99
		a = append(a, k)    // Add the generated number to the slice 'a'
	}
	fmt.Println(a) // Print the slice with the random numbers

	// Modify each element in the slice 'a' to be 5
	for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
		a[i] = 5 // Set the value at index 'i' to 5
	}
	fmt.Println(a) // Print the updated slice (all elements should be 5)

	// Modify each element in the slice 'a' to be 10 using a range loop
	for i, _ := range a {
		a[i] = 10 // Set the value at index 'i' to 10
	}
	fmt.Println(a) // Print the updated slice (all elements should be 10)
}
```

### Explanation:

#### 1. **Importing Packages**:
   - **`fmt`**: This package provides functions for formatted I/O operations (e.g., printing values to the console).
   - **`math/rand`**: This package is used to generate random numbers.
   - **`time`**: This package is used for working with time-related operations, such as getting the current Unix timestamp.

#### 2. **Random Seed Initialization**:
   - **`rand.Seed(time.Now().UTC().UnixNano())`**:
     - This line initializes the random number generator with the current Unix timestamp in nanoseconds. This ensures that each time the program runs, it produces different random numbers instead of the same sequence every time.

#### 3. **Creating and Populating the Slice `a`**:
   - **`n := 5`**:
     - This line declares a variable `n` with a value of `5`. It indicates that the program will generate 5 random numbers.
   
   - **`a := []int{}`**:
     - This line initializes an empty slice `a` of integers. It will be used to store the random numbers generated.

   - **`for i := 0; i < n; i++`**:
     - This `for` loop runs 5 times (since `n` is 5). Each time, it generates a random integer and appends it to the slice `a`.
   
   - **`k := rand.Intn(100)`**:
     - This line generates a random integer between `0` and `99` using `rand.Intn(100)`. It returns a non-negative integer less than 100.
   
   - **`a = append(a, k)`**:
     - This line adds the random integer `k` to the slice `a`.

   - **`fmt.Println(a)`**:
     - This prints the slice `a` after it has been populated with 5 random numbers. The printed output will be a slice of integers with random values between 0 and 99.

#### 4. **Modifying the Slice `a` (First Method)**:
   - **`for i := 0; i < len(a); i++`**:
     - This loop iterates over each index `i` of the slice `a`. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(a)-1` (i.e., for each element in the slice).
   
   - **`a[i] = 5`**:
     - Inside the loop, the value at index `i` of slice `a` is set to `5`. This modifies all elements of the slice to be `5`.

   - **`fmt.Println(a)`**:
     - After the loop finishes, it prints the updated slice `a`, which now contains 5 elements, all set to 5.

#### 5. **Modifying the Slice `a` (Second Method)**:
   - **`for i, _ := range a`**:
     - This is a **range-based loop** that iterates over the slice `a`. The `i` variable represents the index of the current element, and the underscore `_` is used to ignore the value (the actual element at that index). This way, we only care about the index, not the value itself.
   
   - **`a[i] = 10`**:
     - Inside the loop, the value at index `i` of slice `a` is set to `10`. This modifies all elements of the slice to be `10`.

   - **`fmt.Println(a)`**:
     - After the loop finishes, it prints the updated slice `a`, which now contains 5 elements, all set to 10.

### Final Output:

1. **First Print (`fmt.Println(a)` after random numbers)**:
   - The output will be a slice of 5 random numbers, such as:
     ```
     [53 23 90 12 75]
     ```
     (Note: This will change every time you run the program because of the randomness.)

2. **Second Print (`fmt.Println(a)` after setting all elements to 5)**:
   - After modifying all elements to 5, the output will be:
     ```
     [5 5 5 5 5]
     ```

3. **Third Print (`fmt.Println(a)` after setting all elements to 10)**:
   - After modifying all elements to 10, the output will be:
     ```
     [10 10 10 10 10]
     ```

### Key Concepts:

- **Random Number Generation (`rand.Intn(100)`)**: Generates a random integer between `0` and `99`.
- **Slices**: A dynamically-sized array in Go. It can be modified using the `append()` function.
- **For Loop**: Used to iterate over the elements of a slice, either by index or using the `range` keyword.
- **Modification of Slice Elements**: The slice elements are modified directly by accessing their indices.

### Conclusion:

- The code demonstrates how to generate random numbers, store them in a slice, and then modify the slice in two different ways: first by setting each element to 5, and then by setting each element to 10.
- The program uses the `rand` package for generating random numbers and shows the use of both traditional `for` loops and `range` loops for iterating over slices in Go.
