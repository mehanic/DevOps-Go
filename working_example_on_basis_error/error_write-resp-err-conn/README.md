This Go program demonstrates an example where the server handles a request by writing a large response body, and the client initiates a request to the server with a very short timeout. This setup results in an error due to the client timing out before the server finishes writing the response. The error is captured and logged in the server's `logWriteErr` function.

### Breakdown of the Code:

#### 1. **HTTP Server:**
   ```go
   http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
       time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)

       data := make([]byte, 1<<20) // 1Mb
       logWriteErr(w.Write(data))  // write tcp [::1]:8080->[::1]:60756: write: broken pipe
   })
   ```
   - **Route Handling (`/`):** The server handles requests to the root ("/") route. 
   - **Sleep (`time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)`):** The handler simulates a delay before writing the response. This delay represents some processing time (3 seconds) that the server takes before sending the response body.
   - **Large Response Body (`data := make([]byte, 1<<20)`):** The server creates a 1MB buffer (`1 << 20` is equivalent to 1MB). This is the body that the server will attempt to send to the client.
   - **Writing Response (`w.Write(data)`):** The server attempts to write the 1MB data to the response body.

   The `logWriteErr` function is used to check if there is an error when writing the response, and it logs the error if it occurs.

#### 2. **Client Request (Simulated in a Goroutine):**
   ```go
   go func() {
       time.Sleep(3 * time.Second) // Wait for server start up.

       client := &http.Client{Timeout: time.Second}
       resp, err := client.Get("http://localhost:8080") //nolint:noctx
       if err != nil {
           // context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers)
           log.Println("cannot do GET: " + err.Error())
           return
       }
       _ = resp.Body.Close()
   }()
   ```
   - **Goroutine:** The client code runs in a separate goroutine to simulate concurrent behavior (client requests while the server is processing).
   - **Client Timeout (`client := &http.Client{Timeout: time.Second}`):** The client is set up with a timeout of **1 second**. This means that if the request doesn't complete within 1 second, it will result in a timeout error.
   - **Request to Server (`client.Get("http://localhost:8080")`):** The client sends a GET request to the server at `http://localhost:8080` after waiting for 3 seconds to allow the server to start up.
   - **Error Handling:** If the client request times out (i.e., the server takes too long to respond), an error message will be logged, indicating that the request exceeded the timeout (`context deadline exceeded`).

#### 3. **Error Logging:**
   ```go
   logWriteErr(_ int, err error) {
       if err != nil {
           log.Println("cannot write response: " + err.Error())
       }
   }
   ```
   - **Logging Errors:** The `logWriteErr` function checks if there was an error while writing the response to the client. If an error occurs (e.g., the client closes the connection or times out), it logs the error message. In this case, the error is likely to be `write: broken pipe` because the client closed the connection before the server could finish writing the response.
   
   The error `write tcp [::1]:8080->[::1]:60756: write: broken pipe` occurs when the server tries to send data to a client that has already closed the connection (in this case, the client times out before the server finishes writing).

#### 4. **Behavior and Error Explanation:**

- **Server Delay:** The server delays sending the response for 3 seconds using `time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)`. The client, on the other hand, has a timeout of 1 second, which is less than the delay on the server.
- **Timeout and Broken Pipe:** Since the client has a timeout of 1 second (`client := &http.Client{Timeout: time.Second}`), the client cancels the connection after 1 second if the server doesn't respond. When the server attempts to write the large 1MB body after the 3-second delay, the client has already closed the connection, causing the "broken pipe" error.
- **`broken pipe` Error:** This error is related to attempting to write data to a TCP connection that has been closed by the peer (in this case, the client). The error is logged by the server in the `logWriteErr` function.

#### 5. **The Output of the Program:**
   - When the server tries to write the large 1MB response body to the client, the client has already timed out and closed the connection. This results in the "broken pipe" error, which is logged by the server.
   - The clientâ€™s timeout error (`context deadline exceeded`) is also logged by the client, indicating that the request took too long and exceeded the 1-second timeout.

### Key Concepts and Explanation of Errors:
1. **Timeout on Client Side (`context deadline exceeded`):**
   - The client set with a 1-second timeout (`client := &http.Client{Timeout: time.Second}`) cannot wait for the 3-second server delay. Therefore, it times out after 1 second and reports the `context deadline exceeded` error.
  
2. **Broken Pipe on Server Side (`write: broken pipe`):**
   - The server attempts to write a 1MB response after a 3-second delay, but by this time, the client has already disconnected due to the timeout. This causes a `write: broken pipe` error because the server tries to write to a closed connection.

### Summary:
- **Timeout Mismatch:** The client timeout is too short compared to the server's processing time, leading to the client closing the connection before the server finishes writing the response.
- **Logging Errors:** The errors that occur during the write process are captured and logged, including the broken pipe error caused by the client disconnecting prematurely.
