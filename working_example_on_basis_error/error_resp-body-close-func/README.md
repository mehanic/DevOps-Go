This Go program demonstrates making an HTTP GET request, reading the response body, and handling errors. Let's break it down and explain the rules and best practices:

### Code Breakdown:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	index, err := httpGet("http://www.golang-courses.ru/")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(string(index)[:300]) // Print the first 300 characters of the response
}

func httpGet(url string) ([]byte, error) {
	res, err := http.Get(url) //nolint:noctx
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("cannot do GET: %v", err)
	}
	defer res.Body.Close()

	body, err := io.ReadAll(res.Body)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("cannot read body: %v", err)
	}

	if err := res.Body.Close(); err != nil { // Closing again (this is unnecessary)
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("cannot close body: %v", err)
	}
	return body, nil
}
```

### Key Concepts and Rules:

#### 1. **HTTP GET Request**:
   - The program performs an HTTP GET request using the `http.Get` function, which is provided by the Go standard library.
   
     ```go
     res, err := http.Get(url)
     ```
     - This function performs a synchronous GET request to the given URL and returns an `http.Response` object (`res`) and an error (`err`).

#### 2. **Error Handling**:
   - After calling `http.Get()`, we check if an error occurred:
   
     ```go
     if err != nil {
         return nil, fmt.Errorf("cannot do GET: %v", err)
     }
     ```
     - If there is an error, we return `nil` as the body and wrap the error with additional context using `fmt.Errorf`.
     
     This pattern is common in Go and ensures that the error is communicated back to the caller with useful context, helping to debug issues in the program.

#### 3. **Defer `Close`**:
   - The `defer` statement ensures that the `res.Body.Close()` method is called when the function finishes executing, even if an error occurs earlier in the function.
   
     ```go
     defer res.Body.Close()
     ```
     - This is important for cleaning up resources, as HTTP responses can contain resources that need to be freed (e.g., file handles, network connections).
     
     By using `defer`, we make sure the `Body.Close()` is called automatically when the function exits, which is a good practice for resource management in Go.

#### 4. **Reading the Response Body**:
   - The response body is read using the `io.ReadAll` function:
   
     ```go
     body, err := io.ReadAll(res.Body)
     ```
     - `io.ReadAll` reads the entire body of the HTTP response into memory. If the reading operation fails, it returns an error, which is handled and wrapped in a new error message:
     
       ```go
       if err != nil {
           return nil, fmt.Errorf("cannot read body: %v", err)
       }
       ```

#### 5. **Unnecessary Second `Close()` Call**:
   - After using `defer` to call `res.Body.Close()` at the end of the function, there's an unnecessary second attempt to close the response body:
   
     ```go
     if err := res.Body.Close(); err != nil {
         return nil, fmt.Errorf("cannot close body: %v", err)
     }
     ```
     - This is redundant because the first `defer` statement already ensures that `res.Body.Close()` is called when the function finishes executing. Therefore, this second call to `Close()` is not needed and is more of a mistake.

   **Rule**: Do not call `Close()` twice on the same resource. Using `defer` should suffice, and the resource will be closed automatically when the function exits.

#### 6. **Return the Response Body**:
   - If everything goes smoothly (i.e., no errors), the body of the HTTP response is returned to the caller:
   
     ```go
     return body, nil
     ```

#### 7. **Main Function - Output**:
   - The `main()` function calls the `httpGet()` function, checks for errors, and prints the first 300 characters of the response body:
   
     ```go
     fmt.Println(string(index)[:300])
     ```
     - This will output the first 300 characters of the HTML (or text) returned from the URL.
     - It’s important to note that this may not be fully representative of the response, depending on its size and content type, but it's useful for a quick preview of the response.

#### 8. **Error Handling in `main()`**:
   - The `main()` function handles any error returned by `httpGet()` using the `log.Fatal(err)` function:
   
     ```go
     if err != nil {
         log.Fatal(err)
     }
     ```
     - `log.Fatal()` will print the error and terminate the program if an error is encountered, which is often used for critical errors where continuing execution doesn’t make sense.

### Best Practices and Improvements:

1. **Avoid Calling `Close()` Multiple Times**:
   - As mentioned, the second call to `Close()` is unnecessary. This should be removed to avoid redundancy and potential errors.

   **Improvement**:
   ```go
   // Remove this block as it's already handled by defer
   // if err := res.Body.Close(); err != nil {
   //    return nil, fmt.Errorf("cannot close body: %v", err)
   // }
   ```

2. **Context**:
   - The `http.Get` function is used without a `context`, as indicated by the `//nolint:noctx` comment. Using contexts is generally recommended when making HTTP requests to allow for cancellation, timeouts, and deadlines. Without context, the request will continue until it completes, regardless of any external conditions.
   
   **Improvement**:
   ```go
   ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 10*time.Second)
   defer cancel()

   res, err := http.Get(ctx, url)
   ```

3. **Error Wrapping**:
   - The `fmt.Errorf` function with the `%w` verb could be used to wrap errors, so they can be unwrapped later using `errors.Unwrap()` or `errors.Is()`. This would allow more detailed error handling in case of failures.

   **Improvement**:
   ```go
   return nil, fmt.Errorf("cannot do GET request: %w", err)
   ```

### Conclusion:

This program demonstrates good error handling practices, such as using `defer` to ensure resources are properly cleaned up and wrapping errors with context for better debugging. However, it also contains a redundant `Close()` call, which should be removed to avoid confusion. Additionally, using a context would make the program more robust by allowing request cancellation or timeouts.
