This Go program demonstrates the use of **deferred function calls** with a specific focus on the `defer` keyword's behavior. It also showcases basic file handling, error checking, and the Fibonacci sequence generator. Let's break down the key sections and explain the rules and behavior.

### 1. **The `tryDefer` Function**
```go
func tryDefer() {
	for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
		defer fmt.Println(i)
		if i == 30 {
			// Uncomment panic to see
			// how it works with defer
			// panic("printed too many")
		}
	}
}
```

#### Explanation of `defer` behavior:
- **`defer` Statement**: 
  - The `defer` keyword postpones the execution of a function (in this case, `fmt.Println(i)`) until the surrounding function (`tryDefer()`) has completed, even if the function terminates prematurely (due to a panic or early return).
  - **Deferred executions are stacked** in the order they appear, meaning that they will execute in **LIFO (Last In First Out) order**.
  - In this case, `fmt.Println(i)` is deferred for every iteration of the loop (`i` from 0 to 99).
  
- **Without `panic`**:
  - Since `defer` calls are executed after the function completes, you would expect the printed numbers to start from 99 and go down to 0. This is because of the LIFO order.
  
- **If `panic` is uncommented**:
  - If `panic("printed too many")` were uncommented, the program would panic when `i == 30`. However, even in the case of a panic, **all deferred functions would still execute** before the panic propagates, printing the numbers from 99 to 30 (LIFO order). Once `panic` occurs, the program would stop, and the panic message would be shown.

#### Output (Without Panic):
```
99
98
97
...
3
2
1
0
```

This happens because each deferred print statement is stacked and executed in reverse order, as described above.

### 2. **The `writeFile` Function**
```go
func writeFile(filename string) {
	file, err := os.OpenFile(filename,
		os.O_EXCL|os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY, 0666)

	if err != nil {
		if pathError, ok := err.(*os.PathError); !ok {
			panic(err)
		} else {
			fmt.Printf("%s, %s, %s\n",
				pathError.Op,
				pathError.Path,
				pathError.Err)
		}
		return
	}
	defer file.Close()

	writer := bufio.NewWriter(file)
	defer writer.Flush()

	f := fibonacci()
	for i := 0; i < 20; i++ {
		fmt.Fprintln(writer, f())
	}
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **File Handling**:
  - The function `os.OpenFile` is used to open (or create) a file at the specified `filename`. The flags `os.O_EXCL|os.O_CREATE|os.O_WRONLY` ensure the file is created if it doesn't exist and opened for writing.
  - If there's an error, it checks whether it's a path-related error (`*os.PathError`). If it is, it prints the error details. If not, it panics with the error.
  - The `defer file.Close()` ensures the file is closed once the function completes, even if there's an error during file writing.
  
- **Buffered Writing**:
  - The `bufio.NewWriter(file)` creates a buffered writer, and `defer writer.Flush()` ensures the buffered data is written to the file once the function completes.

- **Writing Fibonacci Numbers**:
  - The `fibonacci()` function returns a closure that generates Fibonacci numbers.
  - In the loop, the Fibonacci numbers are written to the file using `fmt.Fprintln(writer, f())`.

#### Output:
- The function writes the first 20 Fibonacci numbers into the file specified (`fib.txt`).
  
### 3. **Fibonacci Function**
```go
func fibonacci() func() int {
	a, b := 0, 1
	return func() int {
		a, b = b, a+b
		return a
	}
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Fibonacci Generator**:
  - The `fibonacci` function returns a closure that generates Fibonacci numbers.
  - Initially, `a = 0` and `b = 1`.
  - Each time the closure is called, it updates `a` and `b` and returns the current value of `a`.
  - This is a classic example of generating Fibonacci numbers using closures.

### 4. **Main Function**
```go
func main() {
	tryDefer()
	writeFile("fib.txt")
}
```

#### Explanation:
- **Calling `tryDefer`**: 
  - This function is called first, which triggers the loop that defers printing numbers from 99 down to 0.
  
- **Calling `writeFile`**: 
  - This function writes the first 20 Fibonacci numbers to the file `fib.txt`. The deferred closing of the file and flushing of the writer ensures proper cleanup.

### Key Takeaways:
1. **`defer` behavior**:
   - Deferred functions are executed after the surrounding function completes.
   - They are executed in **LIFO (Last In First Out)** order.
   - Even if the function panics, deferred functions will still be executed.
   
2. **File Handling**:
   - Always ensure resources like files are properly closed by using `defer`.
   - In case of file errors, handle them appropriately (in this case, checking for path errors).

3. **Buffered Writing**:
   - Using a buffered writer with `defer writer.Flush()` ensures efficient writing and proper cleanup.

4. **Closures**:
   - The Fibonacci function is a good example of closures in Go, where a function retains access to variables even after the enclosing function has returned.

### Expected Output (Assuming No Panic):
```
99
98
97
...
3
2
1
0
```

Additionally, the Fibonacci sequence (first 20 numbers) would be written to the file `fib.txt`.

### If a Panic Occurs (by Uncommenting `panic` inside `tryDefer`):
- The output will still show numbers from 99 down to 30 (due to deferred `fmt.Println(i)` calls).
- The program will panic after printing `30`, and the Fibonacci numbers will still be written to the file, but no further execution will occur after the panic.
