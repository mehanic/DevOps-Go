This Go program demonstrates a few key concepts related to errors, including custom error types, comparison of error values, and using the `errors.Is()` function for error comparisons. Let's break down the rules demonstrated in the program:

### Key Concepts and Rules

1. **Creating Custom Errors with `StatusError` Struct**
   
   The `StatusError` struct is defined as a custom error type that holds an HTTP status code (`code`) and an associated message (`msg`).

   ```go
   type StatusError struct {
       code int
       msg  string
   }
   
   func (s *StatusError) Error() string {
       return fmt.Sprintf("%d %s", s.code, s.msg)
   }
   ```

   - The `StatusError` struct is a custom error type that implements the `Error()` method, which makes it fulfill the `error` interface.
   - The `Error()` method returns a formatted string that represents the error, in this case, the HTTP status code and the associated message.

2. **Using `NewStatusError` to Create Errors**

   The `NewStatusError` function is a constructor for creating instances of the `StatusError` type:

   ```go
   func NewStatusError(code int, msg string) *StatusError {
       return &StatusError{code: code, msg: msg}
   }
   ```

   - `NewStatusError` takes an HTTP status code and a message and returns a pointer to a new `StatusError` instance.
   - The returned error type (`*StatusError`) is a pointer to `StatusError`, which is typically used to avoid unnecessary copying of error data.

3. **Comparing Pointers**

   The following comparison demonstrates the use of `==` with pointers:

   ```go
   ErrNotFound  = NewStatusError(http.StatusNotFound, "Not Found")
   ErrNotFound2 = NewStatusError(http.StatusNotFound, "Not Found")
   ```

   - `ErrNotFound` and `ErrNotFound2` are two separate instances created using `NewStatusError`.
   - Despite having the same values (`http.StatusNotFound` and `"Not Found"`), these are **different** instances, so comparing them with `==` results in `false`.
   - **Pointers** to different instances are not considered equal, even if the data inside those instances is identical.

   ```go
   fmt.Println(ErrNotFound == ErrNotFound2)          // false
   fmt.Println(errors.Is(ErrNotFound, ErrNotFound2)) // false
   ```

   - `ErrNotFound == ErrNotFound2` returns `false` because they are different pointers, even though their values are the same.
   - `errors.Is(ErrNotFound, ErrNotFound2)` also returns `false`, as `errors.Is()` checks whether the errors are the same or one error wraps the other. Since these are different error instances, the result is `false`.

4. **Creating and Comparing Two Errors with Same Code but Different Instances**

   ```go
   var se1 error = &StatusError{code: http.StatusNotFound}
   var se2 error = &StatusError{code: http.StatusNotFound}
   fmt.Println(se1 == se2) // false
   ```

   - Even though `se1` and `se2` are of the same type (`*StatusError`) and have the same `code`, they are **different instances**. Therefore, comparing them with `==` will return `false`, as they are not the same memory address.
   - This highlights that two separate instances of an error type are not considered equal, even if their contents are identical.

5. **Size of Error Pointers**

   ```go
   fmt.Println(unsafe.Sizeof(ErrNotFound)) // 8 (pointer).
   ```

   - `unsafe.Sizeof(ErrNotFound)` prints the size of the `ErrNotFound` pointer, which is `8` on a 64-bit system (size of a pointer in bytes).
   - This is because `ErrNotFound` is a pointer to a `StatusError` struct, and the pointer itself takes up 8 bytes (on 64-bit systems).

### Important Points

- **Pointer Comparison**: When comparing error variables (or any variables) using `==` in Go, you are comparing the **pointers**. Two pointers that point to different memory addresses are not equal, even if the data they point to is identical.
- **`errors.Is` Function**: The `errors.Is()` function checks if two errors are the same or if one error wraps another. In this case, because `ErrNotFound` and `ErrNotFound2` are separate instances, `errors.Is` returns `false`.
- **Custom Error Types**: A custom error type (like `StatusError`) can be used to represent more complex error information (e.g., HTTP status codes). This is done by defining a struct and implementing the `Error()` method to satisfy the `error` interface.
- **Size of Error Types**: When dealing with pointers to error types, the size of the pointer is typically `8` bytes on a 64-bit architecture. This is the memory size of a pointer, not the size of the struct or the data it points to.

### Summary of Output:

1. **First Output (`ErrNotFound`)**: The `fmt.Println(ErrNotFound)` prints the string representation of the error using the `Error()` method defined in the `StatusError` struct, which will output `404 Not Found`.

2. **Second Output (`unsafe.Sizeof(ErrNotFound)`)**: The size of the pointer to the error is printed as `8`, which is the size of a pointer on a 64-bit system.

3. **Comparison of Errors**:
   - `ErrNotFound == ErrNotFound2` prints `false` because they are two different pointers, even though they represent the same error message.
   - `errors.Is(ErrNotFound, ErrNotFound2)` prints `false` for the same reason.
   - `se1 == se2` prints `false` because the two error instances are different (they have different memory addresses).

### Conclusion:

- **Pointer Comparisons**: When comparing errors (or any values), you are comparing their memory addresses if they are pointers. Even if two error instances have the same content, they are not equal unless they refer to the same memory location.
- **`errors.Is()`** is used to check if two errors are the same or if one error wraps another. In this case, since the errors are separate instances, the comparison returns `false`.
