Let's break down the code step by step, focusing on the main rules and concepts used in the code, including the linting directives and error handling.

### **Code Explanation**

```go
var КонецФайла = errors.New("конец файла") //nolint:asciicheck,errname,revive,stylecheck
```
- **`КонецФайла`**: This is a variable that holds an error, specifically created using `errors.New` to return a string error message `"конец файла"` (which translates to "end of file" in Russian).
  
- **`//nolint:asciicheck,errname,revive,stylecheck`**: This is a linting directive comment. It tells the linter to ignore the following lint checks:
  - `asciicheck`: This check warns when non-ASCII characters are used in identifiers (e.g., the Cyrillic characters in `КонецФайла`).
  - `errname`: This check expects error variables to follow the convention of naming errors in Go (e.g., using a lowercase name or naming errors with a specific suffix like `Err`).
  - `revive`: This is another linter that checks for code style issues, including naming conventions and other best practices.
  - `stylecheck`: This one checks for a variety of style issues, including naming conventions and code formatting.
  
  The `nolint` directive is used to suppress these checks because the developer intentionally uses non-ASCII characters (in the variable name) and does not want to follow the conventional naming style for errors.

```go
verbs := []string{"%s", "%q", "%+q", "%v", "%#v"}
```
- Here, we define a slice of strings called `verbs`. Each string is a formatting verb that will be used to format the error in different ways using `fmt.Printf`.
  - `%s`: Formats the error as a simple string.
  - `%q`: Formats the error as a quoted string (useful for showing strings with their quotes).
  - `%+q`: Formats the error with its stack trace (if it supports it) and includes the quotes.
  - `%v`: Formats the error in its default format.
  - `%#v`: Formats the error as Go syntax (e.g., as a type with its value).

```go
for _, err := range []error{КонецФайла, io.EOF} {
    for _, f := range verbs {
        fmt.Printf("%3s - \t"+f, f, err)
        fmt.Println()
    }
    fmt.Println()
}
```
- **Outer loop**: Iterates over a slice of errors, which includes two errors: `КонецФайла` (the custom error in Russian) and `io.EOF` (a standard Go error representing the end of a file).
  
- **Inner loop**: For each error (`err`), we iterate over the `verbs` slice, applying each formatting verb `f` to the error using `fmt.Printf`. The error is printed in different formats as specified by the verbs.

- **`fmt.Printf("%3s - \t"+f, f, err)`**: This prints each formatting verb `f`, followed by the formatted error `err`. Here's how it works:
  - The first argument `"%3s - \t"+f` formats the verb `f` as a string of width 3 (with padding), followed by a tab.
  - Then, the format `f` is used to print the error `err` in the desired format.

- **`fmt.Println()`**: A new line is printed after each formatted error output.

### **What Happens When You Run the Code:**
1. For each error (`КонецФайла` and `io.EOF`), it will print the error in different formats (based on the `verbs` slice). The formats include simple string format (`%s`), quoted string format (`%q`), quoted string with stack trace (`%+q`), default format (`%v`), and Go syntax format (`%#v`).
   
2. The output will look like this (approximate example):

```text
  %s - 	конец файла
  %q - 	"конец файла"
 %+q - 	"конец файла"
  %v - 	конец файла
 %#v - 	errors.New("конец файла")

  %s - 	io.EOF
  %q - 	"io.EOF"
 %+q - 	"io.EOF"
  %v - 	io.EOF
 %#v - 	errors.New("EOF")
```

### **Key Points and Rules in This Code:**

1. **Custom Error `КонецФайла`**:
   - The error variable `КонецФайла` is created using `errors.New`. It contains a string message in Russian, `"конец файла"`, which means "end of file".
   - The `//nolint` directive is used to ignore certain linter checks that would normally flag this code for non-ASCII characters and unconventional error naming.

2. **Different Format Verbs**:
   - We use different format verbs (`%s`, `%q`, `%+q`, `%v`, `%#v`) to print the error in different formats. These are standard formatting verbs used with `fmt.Printf` in Go to control how the output appears.

3. **Error Formatting and Printing**:
   - The errors are printed using `fmt.Printf` in various formats to showcase how different format specifiers affect the output of an error. This is useful for debugging and understanding the structure of an error, especially when working with wrapped or custom errors.

4. **Suppressing Linter Warnings**:
   - The `//nolint:asciicheck,errname,revive,stylecheck` directive suppresses certain linter warnings about the use of non-ASCII characters in identifiers and unconventional naming conventions for error variables. While it’s generally a good idea to follow Go conventions, this directive can be used to bypass linting when there’s a specific need, such as when you want to use a non-ASCII string for a variable name (as in this case with the Russian error message).

### **Conclusion:**
This code demonstrates how to define custom errors, how to format errors using different format verbs, and how to suppress linting warnings when using non-standard naming conventions or characters in Go. The `//nolint` directive is used to avoid errors from linting tools that might otherwise flag this code for non-ASCII characters or unconventional naming conventions, allowing for flexibility in naming and code style.
