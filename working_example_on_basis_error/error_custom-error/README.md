The Go code you've provided demonstrates a simple approach for handling errors in mathematical calculations. Specifically, the program calculates the square root of a series of numbers while handling the error that occurs when attempting to compute the square root of a negative number.

Letâ€™s break down the key components of the code and explain the rules:

### 1. **Defining a Custom Error**
```go
var ErrNorgateMath = errors.New("norgate math: square root of negative number")
```
- **`ErrNorgateMath`** is a custom error created using the `errors.New` function. This error represents the specific issue where the program attempts to calculate the square root of a negative number, which is mathematically invalid for real numbers.
- By defining a custom error, the program can return this specific error when encountering problematic inputs, making the error handling more descriptive.

### 2. **Test Cases for Square Root Calculation**
```go
testValues := []float64{16, 0, -10, 25, -7}
```
- **`testValues`** is an array of floating-point numbers that are used as input values for the square root calculation. The values are a mix of valid numbers (`16`, `0`, `25`) and invalid numbers (`-10`, `-7`) that will trigger the error.

### 3. **Square Root Calculation**
```go
result, err := sqrt(value)
if err != nil {
    log.Printf("Error: %v (input: %v)\n", err, value)
    continue
}
fmt.Printf("The square root of %.2f is %.2f\n", value, result)
```
- **`sqrt(value)`** is called for each value in `testValues`. This function attempts to calculate the square root of the number.
- If **`sqrt`** encounters a negative value, it returns an error (`ErrNorgateMath`). This error is caught using the `if err != nil` condition, and the error message is logged using `log.Printf`.
  - **Logging the Error**: The `log.Printf` function is used to print the error message to the log along with the problematic input value.
  - **`continue`**: If an error occurs (e.g., for negative values), the loop continues to the next number, skipping the current iteration.
- If the calculation is successful (i.e., no error), the program prints the result of the square root calculation.

### 4. **`sqrt` Function**
```go
func sqrt(f float64) (float64, error) {
    if f < 0 {
        return 0, ErrNorgateMath
    }
    return math.Sqrt(f), nil
}
```
- The **`sqrt`** function is responsible for calculating the square root of the input value:
  - **Error for Negative Input**: If the input (`f`) is less than 0, the function returns `0` and the custom error `ErrNorgateMath`, indicating that the square root of a negative number is not valid.
  - **Valid Square Root Calculation**: If the input is valid (greater than or equal to 0), the function calculates and returns the square root using `math.Sqrt(f)` and a `nil` error.

### 5. **Program Output**
Here is the expected output for the input values:
```
The square root of 16.00 is 4.00
The square root of 0.00 is 0.00
2025/02/14 15:06:38 Error: norgate math: square root of negative number (input: -10)
The square root of 25.00 is 5.00
2025/02/14 15:06:38 Error: norgate math: square root of negative number (input: -7)
```
- For valid inputs (like `16`, `0`, and `25`), the program calculates and prints the square root.
- For invalid inputs (like `-10` and `-7`), it logs an error message indicating that the square root of a negative number is not possible.

### Rules and Key Concepts:

1. **Custom Error Handling**:
   - **Creating a custom error** (`ErrNorgateMath`) allows the program to be specific about the issue, in this case, when trying to compute the square root of a negative number.
   - This error can be reused throughout the program to handle the same kind of error consistently.

2. **Graceful Error Handling**:
   - The program checks for errors returned by the `sqrt` function and handles them by logging the error with context (including the problematic input value). This ensures that the program doesn't crash but continues to process other inputs.

3. **Error Propagation**:
   - Errors are propagated from the `sqrt` function to the `main` function. If an error occurs, the function returns a specific error, and the caller can handle it appropriately (e.g., by logging the error).

4. **Avoiding Crashes**:
   - The program avoids crashing by using the `continue` statement when an error is encountered, allowing it to skip over the invalid value and proceed with the rest of the inputs.

5. **Mathematical Constraints**:
   - The program demonstrates handling a basic mathematical constraint (square root of negative numbers) and provides a clear and informative error message when this constraint is violated.

### Conclusion:

The program showcases how to handle errors in Go, especially when performing mathematical operations. By creating custom error types, checking for errors after function calls, and logging those errors when needed, the program ensures that errors are managed in a clear and consistent way. This prevents the program from crashing due to invalid inputs and provides useful feedback to the user or developer.
