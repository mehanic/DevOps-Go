This Go code sets up an HTTP server with various handlers that simulate specific error conditions related to response writing. The goal is to handle potential issues (such as hijacking a connection, sending an empty body, or mismatched `Content-Length`) and log the errors when they occur.

Let's break down the rules and concepts:

### Key Elements:
1. **HTTP Handlers and Routes:**
   - The server defines multiple HTTP routes that simulate specific error conditions when writing responses.
   - The routes are as follows:
     - `/hijack-err`: Simulates hijacking the HTTP connection.
     - `/body-not-allowed-err`: Simulates writing a body when it's not allowed (e.g., after sending a `204 No Content` status).
     - `/content-length-err`: Simulates writing a response body that doesn't match the declared `Content-Length` header.

2. **Hijacking a Connection:**
   ```go
   hj, ok := w.(http.Hijacker)
   if !ok {
       http.Error(w, "no hijacking support", http.StatusInternalServerError)
       return
   }

   conn, _, err := hj.Hijack()
   if err != nil {
       http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
       return
   }
   defer conn.Close()
   ```
   - This block checks if the `http.ResponseWriter` supports hijacking using the `http.Hijacker` interface. If hijacking is not supported, it responds with an HTTP 500 error.
   - If hijacking is supported, it hijacks the connection, allowing raw data to be written directly to the connection (bypassing HTTP semantics). After hijacking the connection, the handler attempts to send a response body, which causes an error because the connection has been hijacked, and no further HTTP-related response is possible.

3. **Writing Response with Incorrect Status (`204 No Content`):**
   ```go
   w.WriteHeader(http.StatusNoContent)
   w.Header().Set("content-type", "application/json")
   logWriteErr(w.Write([]byte(`{"msg": "OK"}`)))
   ```
   - The `204 No Content` status code explicitly indicates that the server has processed the request but has no content to send back. As per the HTTP specification, the `204 No Content` status should not have a response body.
   - If you attempt to write a body after setting the `204 No Content` status, it results in an error. The code logs the error message when this happens.

4. **Content-Length Mismatch:**
   ```go
   w.Header().Set("content-type", "application/json")
   w.Header().Set("content-length", "1")
   logWriteErr(w.Write([]byte(`{"msg": "OK"}`)))
   ```
   - This handler simulates a mismatch between the declared `Content-Length` header and the actual size of the response body. The `Content-Length` header is set to 1, but the actual body is longer than 1 byte (`{"msg": "OK"}` is 13 bytes).
   - This mismatch leads to an error because the client expects the body size to match the `Content-Length` header.

5. **Generic Response Handler (No Error Condition):**
   ```go
   w.Header().Set("content-type", "application/json")
   logWriteErr(w.Write([]byte(`{"msg": "OK"}`)))
   ```
   - This handler sets the content type and writes the response body as usual. It checks for errors when writing the body, but in this case, no error is expected unless there are issues with the HTTP connection.

6. **`logWriteErr` Function:**
   ```go
   func logWriteErr(_ int, err error) {
       if err != nil {
           log.Println("cannot write response: " + err.Error())
       }
   }
   ```
   - This function is responsible for logging errors that occur while writing the response body. It takes two parameters:
     - `_ int`: This represents the number of bytes written, but it's ignored in the function because only the error is of interest.
     - `err error`: This is the error that occurred during the write operation. If the error is not `nil`, it logs the error message.
   - For each HTTP handler, after attempting to write a response body, `logWriteErr` is called to log any issues that might arise.

### Explanation of the Errors:

1. **Hijacking Error (`http: connection has been hijacked`):**
   - When you hijack a connection using `http.Hijacker`, the HTTP server loses control over that connection. Consequently, you can no longer send HTTP responses (headers or body) using the `http.ResponseWriter`.
   - Attempting to write the response body after hijacking the connection causes this error: `http: connection has been hijacked`.

2. **Body Not Allowed Error (`http: request method or response status code does not allow body`):**
   - If the server responds with a `204 No Content` status, no response body should be sent. Writing a body in such cases results in the error: `http: request method or response status code does not allow body`.
   - This error occurs because the `204` status code explicitly prohibits sending a body with the response.

3. **Content-Length Mismatch Error (`wrote more than the declared Content-Length`):**
   - If the `Content-Length` header specifies a size, the body sent should match that size. If the body size exceeds the declared `Content-Length`, it triggers an error like `wrote more than the declared Content-Length`.
   - In this code, `w.Header().Set("content-length", "1")` sets the `Content-Length` to 1 byte, but the body (`{"msg": "OK"}`) is much larger, leading to an error.

### Key Concepts:
- **Hijacking Connections**: In Go, the `http.Hijacker` interface allows you to take over an HTTP connection to write raw data directly. However, once a connection is hijacked, you can no longer use the normal HTTP response mechanism, leading to errors if you try to write to the response.
  
- **HTTP Status Codes**: Certain status codes (like `204 No Content`) do not allow a response body. Trying to write a body with such status codes results in errors.

- **Content-Length Mismatch**: The `Content-Length` header must accurately reflect the size of the response body. If there is a mismatch between the declared length and the actual body size, it causes an error.

### Summary:
This code demonstrates various error scenarios related to writing HTTP responses:
1. Hijacking a connection and attempting to write a response causes a hijack-related error.
2. Writing a response body after setting a `204 No Content` status results in an error because the body is not allowed.
3. Setting an incorrect `Content-Length` header and writing a body that exceeds the declared length triggers a mismatch error.
Each error is logged using the `logWriteErr` function, helping identify issues when they occur.
