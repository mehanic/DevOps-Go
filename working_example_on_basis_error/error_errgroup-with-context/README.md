In this Go program, you're tasked with performing concurrent network requests to a list of URLs using multiple worker goroutines. The program uses `errgroup.Group` to manage the concurrent execution of these requests and handles errors gracefully. Let me explain the key parts of the code and the rules being followed.

### Key Concepts and Rules:

#### 1. **`errgroup.Group` and Context Management:**
   - **`errgroup.Group`**: This is part of the `golang.org/x/sync/errgroup` package, which helps in managing concurrent tasks (goroutines) while handling errors. The group waits for all the goroutines to finish and propagates the first error encountered.
   - **`context`**: A `context` is used for canceling the operation (i.e., shutting down the network requests early if there's an error or if the context is canceled). The context ensures that the workers will stop if something goes wrong, preventing them from continuing after an error occurs.

#### 2. **Channels for Communication:**
   - **`urls` Channel**: A `channel` named `urls` is created to pass URLs to worker goroutines. The URLs are generated by a goroutine and sent into the channel to be processed by the worker goroutines.
   - **Closing the Channel**: The `urls` channel is closed once all URLs are sent to the workers, which signals the workers to stop waiting for new URLs. This is handled in a `defer` statement in the main goroutine after sending all URLs.

#### 3. **Worker Goroutines:**
   - **`eg.Go`**: The `eg.Go` function is used to launch new worker goroutines. For each worker, it listens on the `urls` channel and processes URLs. The network request for each URL is handled by the `networkRequest` function, which is supposed to simulate making an actual network request (this function is not defined in your code, but we assume it's a placeholder).
   - If any of the workers encounter an error during the network request, they return an error, which stops the execution of all remaining tasks. This is important because if any URL request fails, the program must stop processing further URLs.

#### 4. **Error Handling with `errgroup`:**
   - **Early Cancellation**: If any of the workers return an error (e.g., the network request fails), the `errgroup.Group` will propagate that error immediately and cancel all other goroutines. This is achieved by the use of `ctx` (the context). The context allows all workers to listen for a cancellation signal and terminate early if needed.
   - **Error Propagation**: If any goroutine in the group encounters an error, it will be propagated through `eg.Wait()`, and the program will stop executing, printing the error message.

#### 5. **`eg.Wait()`**:
   - The `eg.Wait()` function blocks until all goroutines are done. If any goroutine encounters an error, `Wait()` will return that error, and the main function will print it.

### Flow of the Program:

1. **Main Goroutine (`eg.Go`)**:
   - The main goroutine creates a `context` and an `errgroup.Group`.
   - It generates URLs and sends them into the `urls` channel. It uses the select statement to check if the context has been canceled (i.e., if an error has occurred) before sending URLs. 
     - For `i == 2`, it intentionally uses an invalid URL (`invalidURL`) to simulate an error in the network request.

2. **Worker Goroutines**:
   - The worker goroutines are launched in a loop (`for i := 0; i < workersCount; i++`), and each worker continuously reads URLs from the `urls` channel and makes a network request using `networkRequest()`.
   - If a worker encounters an error while processing a URL (e.g., if the URL is invalid or the network request fails), it returns the error immediately, which will propagate up through the `errgroup` and cancel other tasks.

3. **Context Handling**:
   - The `ctx.Done()` case in the main goroutineâ€™s `select` statement ensures that if the context is canceled (e.g., an error occurs), the program will stop sending more URLs, and the worker goroutines will stop executing as soon as they process the current URL.

4. **Handling Errors**:
   - If any worker returns an error (e.g., the `networkRequest` fails for a URL), the `errgroup` will ensure that all other workers are stopped, and the first error encountered will be printed in the main goroutine.

### Example with Error Handling:

Let's walk through what happens when you run the program with the given setup:

- The main goroutine sends 100 URLs (starting with `googleURL` and one invalid URL at index `2`).
- The worker goroutines start processing the URLs one by one.
- When a worker processes the invalid URL at index `2`, it calls `networkRequest()`, which simulates an error (e.g., the network request fails).
- Since the error occurs in the worker goroutine, the error is propagated through the `errgroup` and stops all other workers.
- The main goroutine receives the error and prints it (e.g., `network request https://invalid_url error: <error details>`), and the program stops.

### Key Points:

- **Concurrency Control**: Using `errgroup.Group` ensures that the program only continues if all worker goroutines complete successfully. If any one of the workers encounters an error, the program stops early.
- **Context Propagation**: The context (`ctx`) is used to cancel the workers if an error occurs, preventing unnecessary work.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: The program ensures that even if some workers finish early, all workers are properly managed, and no goroutine is left hanging.
  
This program is a good example of handling concurrent network requests in Go, ensuring that all workers stop when any one worker encounters an error, making the error handling process clean and efficient.
