This Go code contains several examples of how errors can be handled in Go using the `error` type, and it also demonstrates some basic functionality like checking whether a number is even, calculating the square root of a number, and opening a file. Let’s break down each part and explain the rules and the related error-handling.

### Code Breakdown:

#### 1. **Checking if the number is even (`evenNum` function)**:
```go
func evenNum(num int) (int, error) {
	if num%2 != 0 {
		return 0, errors.New("ERROR: You did not enter an even number")
	}
	return num, nil
}
```
- **Purpose**: This function checks if a given number is even or not.
  - If the number is **odd** (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`), the function returns an error message: `"ERROR: You did not enter an even number"`.
  - If the number is **even**, the function returns the number itself and `nil` for the error, meaning no error occurred.

- **Error Handling**:
  - If the number is odd, the function will return a non-nil error.
  - If the number is even, no error occurs, and the result is returned with `nil` for the error.

#### 2. **Calculating the square root (`sRoot` function)**:
```go
func sRoot(num float64) (float64, error) {
	if num < 0 {
		return 0, errors.New("Square root of negative numbers cannot be calculated")
	}
	return math.Sqrt(num), nil
}
```
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the square root of a given number.
  - If the number is **negative**, the function returns an error with the message `"Square root of negative numbers cannot be calculated"`.
  - If the number is **non-negative**, it returns the square root of the number and `nil` for the error.

- **Error Handling**:
  - If the number is negative, the function returns an error because calculating the square root of a negative number is mathematically undefined in the real number system.
  - If the number is non-negative, the function computes and returns the square root.

#### 3. **Opening a file (`os.Open`)**:
```go
file, err9 := os.Open("test.txt")
if err9 != nil {
	fmt.Println(err9)
} else {
	fmt.Println("Our file:", file)
}
```
- **Purpose**: This code attempts to open a file named `"test.txt"`.
  - If the file does **not exist** (or there is another error like permission issues), the `os.Open` function will return an error. 
  - If the file is opened successfully, the file handle is returned and printed.

- **Error Handling**:
  - If `os.Open` fails (for example, if `"test.txt"` doesn’t exist), it will return an error like: `"open test.txt: no such file or directory"`.
  - If the file is opened successfully, no error will occur, and the file handle will be printed.

### Expected Output:
Let’s go over the expected output when running this program:

1. **`evenNum(11)`**:
   - Since 11 is **odd**, it will return an error: `ERROR: You did not enter an even number`.

2. **`sRoot(-5)`**:
   - Since -5 is a **negative number**, it will return an error: `Square root of negative numbers cannot be calculated`.

3. **`os.Open("test.txt")`**:
   - If the file `test.txt` does **not exist**, the error message will be: `open test.txt: no such file or directory`.

### Summary of Rules:

1. **Error Handling** in Go: 
   - When a function might fail, it returns an `error` type along with the result. 
   - If an error occurs, it is returned as the second value (and should be checked).
   - If no error occurs, `nil` is returned for the error.

2. **Creating Errors**:
   - Errors are created using the `errors.New` function, which takes a string and creates an error with that message. You can use this for custom error messages (e.g., when checking if a number is even or calculating the square root).

3. **Handling `os.Open` Errors**:
   - `os.Open` returns an error if the file doesn’t exist or there’s some issue opening it. You can check for this error by comparing the result with `nil`.

### In your program, the errors occur because:

- The number 11 is odd (`evenNum`).
- The square root of -5 is undefined (`sRoot`).
- The file `test.txt` doesn’t exist (`os.Open`).
