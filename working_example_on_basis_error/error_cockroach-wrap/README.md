Let's break down the provided code and the rules involved in this Go program, focusing on how errors are wrapped, how error depths are handled, and how the CockroachDB `errors` package is used.

### Code Explanation

#### 1. **`GimmeDeepError` Function**
```go
func GimmeDeepError(depth int) error {
	if depth == 1 {
		return errors.New("ooops, an error on level 1")
	}
	return errors.Wrapf(GimmeDeepError(depth-1), "error happened on level %d", depth)
}
```

- This function generates a deeply nested error by recursively calling itself, wrapping each error with more context at each level.
- The base case is when `depth == 1`. At this point, a new error with the message `"ooops, an error on level 1"` is created and returned.
- If the depth is greater than 1, the function recursively calls itself, reducing the depth by 1, and wraps the returned error with a message indicating at which level the error occurred.
- The error is wrapped using `errors.Wrapf`, which formats a message and wraps the returned error with additional context.
  
#### Example Walkthrough for `GimmeDeepError(5)`:

1. **Level 5:** `GimmeDeepError(5)` calls `GimmeDeepError(4)` and wraps it with `"error happened on level 5"`.
2. **Level 4:** `GimmeDeepError(4)` calls `GimmeDeepError(3)` and wraps it with `"error happened on level 4"`.
3. **Level 3:** `GimmeDeepError(3)` calls `GimmeDeepError(2)` and wraps it with `"error happened on level 3"`.
4. **Level 2:** `GimmeDeepError(2)` calls `GimmeDeepError(1)` and wraps it with `"error happened on level 2"`.
5. **Level 1:** `GimmeDeepError(1)` reaches the base case and returns an error `"ooops, an error on level 1"`.

This creates a stack of wrapped errors like this:

```
error happened on level 5: error happened on level 4: error happened on level 3: error happened on level 2: ooops, an error on level 1
```

Each level adds more context to the error, building a chain of errors from level 1 up to level 5.

#### 2. **Printing the Error with `%+v`**
```go
fmt.Printf("%+v", GimmeDeepError(5))
```

- The `%+v` format specifier is used to print the error with detailed information, including the full error chain, its context, and the stack trace.
  
Since `errors.Wrapf` (from the CockroachDB `errors` package) attaches context to the error at each level, using `%+v` prints the entire chain, showing both the message of each wrapped error and any relevant stack trace information.

#### Output Breakdown:

Given the function `GimmeDeepError(5)`, the output of `fmt.Printf("%+v", GimmeDeepError(5))` would be:

```
error happened on level 5: error happened on level 4: error happened on level 3: error happened on level 2: ooops, an error on level 1
```

- The error messages are printed in reverse order, starting from the outermost error (level 5) and wrapping inwards to level 1.
- Each level adds more context about where the error happened, forming a chain of errors that provides a clear trace of how the error propagates.

### **Key Rules of the Code**

1. **Recursive Error Wrapping**:
   - The `GimmeDeepError` function demonstrates how to recursively wrap errors. Each recursive call adds more context by wrapping the error returned from the previous call.
   
2. **`errors.Wrapf`**:
   - The `errors.Wrapf` function wraps the existing error with additional context, allowing you to build a chain of errors with formatted messages.
   - This is useful for tracking the origin of errors as they propagate through your code.

3. **Error Chain**:
   - The result of `GimmeDeepError(5)` is a chain of errors that provide detailed context about the error's origin at each level.
   - The outermost error (level 5) contains all the context from previous levels, and the innermost error (level 1) is the base error with no additional context.

4. **`%+v` for Detailed Error Output**:
   - Using `%+v` in `fmt.Printf` prints the full error chain, including all wrapped context and stack traces (if available).
   - This is especially helpful when debugging complex errors where you need to understand how the error has propagated and what context has been added at each step.

### **Takeaways:**

- The `errors.Wrapf` function is useful for wrapping errors with context, making it easier to trace the flow of an error through the program.
- The recursive approach allows you to build a detailed error chain, where each error in the chain provides information about where the error occurred.
- The `%+v` format specifier is useful for inspecting the full error chain, showing not only the messages but also stack trace information (depending on how the error was wrapped).
