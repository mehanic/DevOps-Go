Let's break down the code and explain how error wrapping and formatting work in Go, particularly focusing on the use of `fmt.Errorf` and `errors.Wrap` from the `github.com/pkg/errors` package.

### Code Breakdown

#### 1. **First Block: Using `fmt.Errorf` with `%w`**
```go
{
    err := fmt.Errorf("%w: index.html", ErrNotFound)
    fmt.Println(err) // not found: index.html

    err = fmt.Errorf("in the middle: %w: index.html", ErrNotFound)
    fmt.Println(err) // in the middle: not found: index.html

    err = fmt.Errorf("index.html: %w", ErrNotFound)
    fmt.Println(err) // index.html: not found
}
```

- **`fmt.Errorf("%w: index.html", ErrNotFound)`**:
  - **Explanation**: This uses the `%w` format specifier, which is specifically designed to **wrap** an error (`ErrNotFound` in this case) while also allowing you to include a formatted string. The `%w` specifier ensures that `ErrNotFound` is wrapped within the new error.
  - **Output**: `not found: index.html`
    - The error message becomes `"not found: index.html"`, and `ErrNotFound` is the cause of this error. This means `ErrNotFound` is wrapped within the error, but its message is not displayed by default in the output.

- **`fmt.Errorf("in the middle: %w: index.html", ErrNotFound)`**:
  - **Explanation**: This is another example where the `ErrNotFound` error is wrapped with the message `"in the middle: index.html"`. The `%w` still wraps `ErrNotFound`, and the formatted string is placed around it.
  - **Output**: `in the middle: not found: index.html`
    - Here, `"in the middle: not found: index.html"` is the error message. It means that the `ErrNotFound` is wrapped with the text `"in the middle: "`, and the original message of `ErrNotFound` (`"not found"`) is included as part of the error chain.

- **`fmt.Errorf("index.html: %w", ErrNotFound)`**:
  - **Explanation**: This wraps `ErrNotFound` with the message `"index.html: "`.
  - **Output**: `index.html: not found`
    - The error message becomes `"index.html: not found"`, where `"index.html: "` is the added message, and `"not found"` is the message from `ErrNotFound`.

**Note**: 
- The `%w` format specifier is designed for wrapping errors. It allows the wrapped error (`ErrNotFound`) to be part of the new error, meaning you can later use functions like `errors.Is` or `errors.As` to inspect the underlying error (`ErrNotFound` in this case).
- The error string does not include the wrapped errorâ€™s message directly unless you use functions like `fmt.Printf` with `%v` or `%+v` to print the error message fully.

#### 2. **Second Block: Using `errors.Wrap` from `github.com/pkg/errors`**
```go
{
    err := errors.Wrap(ErrNotFound, "index.html")
    fmt.Println(err) // index.html: not found
}
```

- **`errors.Wrap(ErrNotFound, "index.html")`**:
  - **Explanation**: The `errors.Wrap` function from the `github.com/pkg/errors` package wraps the `ErrNotFound` error and adds the message `"index.html"` to it.
  - This works similarly to `fmt.Errorf` with `%w`, but `errors.Wrap` is designed specifically for error wrapping and also provides additional features like stack trace information (which is not utilized here).
  - **Output**: `index.html: not found`
    - The error message becomes `"index.html: not found"`, where `"index.html"` is the message added by `errors.Wrap`, and `"not found"` is the original message from `ErrNotFound`.

### Key Concepts of Error Wrapping in Go

- **`fmt.Errorf` with `%w`**:
  - The `%w` specifier is used for **wrapping** errors. It is used to add additional context to an error message while preserving the original error.
  - The wrapped error (`ErrNotFound`) is stored as the underlying error in the resulting error object, and you can later check if the original error is part of the error chain using functions like `errors.Is()` or `errors.As()`.
  - The `%w` specifier allows error chaining, meaning that the wrapped error can be inspected later.

- **`errors.Wrap`**:
  - `errors.Wrap` is a function from the `github.com/pkg/errors` package that wraps an error and provides the option to add a message.
  - It also maintains the original error as the underlying error, and you can use functions like `errors.Is()` to check if the wrapped error matches a specific error.
  - The `errors.Wrap` function is useful for creating more descriptive errors by adding context, and it is commonly used to enrich the error with additional details.

### Conclusion: Differences Between `fmt.Errorf` and `errors.Wrap`

- **`fmt.Errorf` with `%w`**:
  - Wraps an error, and you can format the error message with additional context.
  - Works with the standard library (`fmt` package).
  - You need to use `%w` explicitly to wrap the error.

- **`errors.Wrap`**:
  - Wraps an error and provides additional context.
  - From the third-party `github.com/pkg/errors` package.
  - Often used in combination with features like stack trace generation.
  
In both cases, wrapping the error ensures that the original error can still be inspected later in the error chain using `errors.Is` or `errors.As`.

### Summary of Outputs:
1. **Using `fmt.Errorf` with `%w`**:
   - `not found: index.html`
   - `in the middle: not found: index.html`
   - `index.html: not found`

2. **Using `errors.Wrap`**:
   - `index.html: not found`
