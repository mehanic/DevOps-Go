### **Explanation of the Code:**

This program calculates the admission price based on the person's **age** and prints the appropriate admission cost.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Declaring Variables**
```go
age := 66
var price int
```
- **`age`** is set to `66`, representing the person's age.
- **`price`** is declared as an integer, and it will be used to store the admission cost based on the `age`.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ The Conditional Logic (If-Else Statement)**
The program uses a series of `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to determine the admission price based on the age. Here's how it works:

#### **a) First Condition (`if age < 4`)**
```go
if age < 4 {
    price = 0
}
```
- If the person's **age is less than 4**, the admission price is set to **$0** (free admission).
- This condition **doesn't match** because the person's age is `66`.

#### **b) Second Condition (`else if age < 18`)**
```go
else if age < 18 {
    price = 5
}
```
- If the person's **age is less than 18**, the admission price is set to **$5**.
- Again, this condition **doesn't match** because the person's age is `66`.

#### **c) Third Condition (`else if age < 65`)**
```go
else if age < 65 {
    price = 10
}
```
- If the person's **age is less than 65**, the admission price is set to **$10**.
- This condition **doesn't match** because the person's age is `66`.

#### **d) Fourth Condition (`else if age > 65`)**
```go
else if age > 65 {
    price = 5
}
```
- If the person's **age is greater than 65**, the admission price is set to **$5**.
- This condition **matches** because the person's age is `66`, so the admission price is set to **$5**.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Printing the Admission Price**
```go
fmt.Printf("Your admission cost is $%d.\n", price)
```
- This line uses the `fmt.Printf` function to print the admission cost stored in the `price` variable. The `%d` format specifier is used to print the integer value of `price`.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Final Output:**
- Since the person's age is **66**, the program matches the fourth condition (`age > 65`), setting the price to **$5**.
- The output will be:
```text
Your admission cost is $5.
```

---

### **üîπ Summary of the Logic:**
- If **age < 4**, admission is free (`$0`).
- If **age < 18** but not less than 4, admission is **$5**.
- If **age < 65**, admission is **$10**.
- If **age > 65**, admission is **$5**.
- The program evaluates these conditions in order and prints the corresponding admission cost.

---

### **In the Example:**
Since the age is **66**, the program selects the last condition and sets the price to **$5**.
