This Go program demonstrates several conditional constructs (`if`, `else if`, and `else`), including the use of an inline variable declaration (`num := 9`) and checks for conditions involving comparison operators.

Let's break it down step by step:

### 1. **First `if` Statement:**
```go
if (3 > 5) {
    fmt.Println("3 больше 5")
} else {
    fmt.Println("3 не больше 5")
}
```
- **Condition (`3 > 5`)**: This checks if `3` is greater than `5`. Since this is **false**, the program executes the `else` block.
- **Output**: Since the condition is false, it prints `"3 не больше 5"`, which means "3 is not greater than 5".

### 2. **Second `if` Statement (Checking Divisibility):**
```go
if (8%4 == 0) {
    fmt.Println("8 делится без остатка на 4")
}
```
- **Condition (`8 % 4 == 0`)**: This checks if `8` is divisible by `4` without a remainder. The modulus operator (`%`) calculates the remainder when `8` is divided by `4`.
- Since `8 % 4 == 0` (i.e., there is no remainder), the condition is **true**, so the program executes the code inside this `if` block.
- **Output**: It prints `"8 делится без остатка на 4"`, which means "8 divides without remainder by 4".

### 3. **Third `if-else` Statement (Using Inline Variable Declaration):**
```go
if num := 9; num < 0 {
    fmt.Println(num, "отрицательное")
} else if (num < 10) {
    fmt.Println(num, "это 1 цифра")
} else {
    fmt.Println(num, "имеет несколько цифр")
}
```
- **Inline Declaration of `num`**: `num := 9` declares and initializes the variable `num` with the value `9` inside the `if` statement. This is a feature in Go, where you can declare a variable inline in an `if` condition.
  
- **Condition (`num < 0`)**: It checks if `num` (which is `9`) is less than `0`. Since `9` is **not** less than `0`, this condition is **false**, and the program moves on to the `else if` block.
  
- **`else if` Condition (`num < 10`)**: This checks if `num` is less than `10`. Since `num` is `9`, this condition is **true**.
  - Since the condition is true, it prints `"9 это 1 цифра"`, which means "9 is a single digit".

- **`else` Block**: This block would have been executed if neither the `if` nor the `else if` conditions were true. But since one of the conditions (`num < 10`) was true, this `else` block is **not executed**.

### **Final Output:**
1. `"3 не больше 5"`: This is printed because the condition `3 > 5` is **false**.
2. `"8 делится без остатка на 4"`: This is printed because `8 % 4 == 0` is **true**.
3. `"9 это 1 цифра"`: This is printed because `num < 10` is **true**.

### **Summary of the Rules**:
1. **Basic `if` and `else`**:
   - If the condition in the `if` statement is true, the code inside the `if` block is executed.
   - If the condition is false, the code inside the `else` block is executed (if an `else` block is present).
   
2. **Modulus Operator (`%`)**:
   - The `%` operator gives the remainder when dividing one number by another. For example, `8 % 4 == 0` checks if `8` is divisible by `4` without a remainder.
   
3. **Inline Variable Declaration**:
   - Go allows you to declare variables inline within an `if` statement using the syntax `if variable := value; condition`. This makes it possible to initialize variables and check conditions in a single statement.
   
4. **Condition Order**:
   - The program evaluates conditions sequentially from top to bottom. If one condition is satisfied (true), it executes the corresponding block and skips the others.
   
### **Output Recap:**
```
3 не больше 5
8 делится без остатка на 4
9 это 1 цифра
```

This output shows that:
1. The first condition checks if `3 > 5` and prints the message for the false condition.
2. The second condition checks if `8` is divisible by `4` and prints the result.
3. The third condition checks if `9` is a single digit, and since it is, it prints that.
