This Go program implements the **FizzBuzz** challenge, which is commonly used in programming exercises. The challenge involves printing numbers from 1 to 50, with the following conditions:

- For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, print "fizzbuzz".
- For numbers divisible only by 3, print "fizz".
- For numbers divisible only by 5, print "buzz".
- For all other numbers, print the number itself.

### **Code Breakdown:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// Loop through numbers from 1 to 50
	for i := 1; i < 51; i++ {
		// Check if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5
		if i%3 == 0 && i%5 == 0 {
			// If divisible by both 3 and 5, print "fizzbuzz"
			fmt.Println("fizzbuzz")
		} else if i%3 == 0 {
			// If divisible by 3, print "fizz"
			fmt.Println("fizz")
		} else if i%5 == 0 {
			// If divisible by 5, print "buzz"
			fmt.Println("buzz")
		} else {
			// If not divisible by 3 or 5, print the number itself
			fmt.Println(i)
		}
	}
}
```

### **Explanation of Each Section:**

1. **The Loop:**
   - `for i := 1; i < 51; i++`: This `for` loop starts at 1 and runs until 50, inclusive. It increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   
2. **Condition for "FizzBuzz":**
   - `if i%3 == 0 && i%5 == 0`: This checks if the current number (`i`) is divisible by both 3 and 5. The `i%3 == 0` condition checks if the number is divisible by 3, and the `i%5 == 0` condition checks if it's divisible by 5. If both conditions are true, it prints "fizzbuzz".
   - Example: For `i = 15`, both 3 and 5 divide evenly, so "fizzbuzz" is printed.

3. **Condition for "Fizz":**
   - `else if i%3 == 0`: If the number is divisible only by 3 (but not by 5), it prints "fizz".
   - Example: For `i = 9`, it's divisible by 3, so "fizz" is printed.

4. **Condition for "Buzz":**
   - `else if i%5 == 0`: If the number is divisible only by 5 (but not by 3), it prints "buzz".
   - Example: For `i = 10`, it's divisible by 5, so "buzz" is printed.

5. **Else Condition (for all other numbers):**
   - `else`: If the number is neither divisible by 3 nor 5, it simply prints the number itself.
   - Example: For `i = 7`, it's neither divisible by 3 nor 5, so the program prints `7`.

### **Output:**

When the program runs, it prints the numbers from 1 to 50 with the corresponding replacements based on divisibility by 3 and 5.

Hereâ€™s an example of the output for the first few numbers:

```

```

### **Summary of Key Rules in the Code:**
1. **Divisibility checks**:
   - The program uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if a number is divisible by another number. For example, `i%3 == 0` checks if `i` is divisible by 3.
   
2. **Nested conditions**:
   - The program first checks for numbers divisible by both 3 and 5. If that's not true, it checks for divisibility by 3 and 5 separately.

3. **Default case**:
   - If none of the conditions are met (the number is not divisible by 3 or 5), it prints the number itself.

This is a simple but effective way of solving the FizzBuzz problem using basic conditional statements and a loop in Go.
