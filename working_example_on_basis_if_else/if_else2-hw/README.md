Let's break down the Go code step by step and explain the rules:

### **Code Breakdown:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// Grades function to determine grade based on score
func Grades(score float32) string {
	if score > 80 {
		return "grade = A"
	}
	if score > 70 {
		return "grade = B"
	}
	if score > 60 {
		return "grade = C"
	}
	if score > 50 {
		return "grade = D"
	}
	return "grade = F"
}

// Students function to return a formatted string with student name
func Students(name string) string {
	return "my name is " + name
}

func main() {
	// Calculating grades for each student based on their scores
	ScoreA := Grades(84)
	ScoreB := Grades(62)
	ScoreC := Grades(49)
	
	// Storing students' names
	student1 := Students("Goodnight")
	student2 := Students("Manbod")
	student3 := Students("Dukdik")
	
	// Printing the student's name and their grade
	fmt.Println(student1, ScoreA)
	fmt.Println(student2, ScoreB)
	fmt.Println(student3, ScoreC)
}
```

### **1. The `Grades` Function:**

```go
func Grades(score float32) string {
	if score > 80 {
		return "grade = A"
	}
	if score > 70 {
		return "grade = B"
	}
	if score > 60 {
		return "grade = C"
	}
	if score > 50 {
		return "grade = D"
	}
	return "grade = F"
}
```

- **Purpose:** This function accepts a student's score (a `float32`) as input and returns a string indicating their grade based on the score. The rules for the grade determination are:
  - If the score is greater than **80**, the grade is `"A"`.
  - If the score is greater than **70** (but less than or equal to 80), the grade is `"B"`.
  - If the score is greater than **60** (but less than or equal to 70), the grade is `"C"`.
  - If the score is greater than **50** (but less than or equal to 60), the grade is `"D"`.
  - If the score is **50 or less**, the grade is `"F"`.

- **How the conditions work:**
  - The function uses sequential `if` statements. The first condition that evaluates as `true` will immediately return the corresponding grade.
  - If none of the conditions are met (i.e., if the score is 50 or less), the default `"grade = F"` is returned.

#### **Example Calculations in the Main Function:**
- For `Grades(84)`:
  - Since 84 is greater than 80, it returns `"grade = A"`.
  
- For `Grades(62)`:
  - 62 is greater than 60, so it returns `"grade = C"`.
  
- For `Grades(49)`:
  - 49 is less than or equal to 50, so it returns `"grade = F"`.

### **2. The `Students` Function:**

```go
func Students(name string) string {
	return "my name is " + name
}
```

- **Purpose:** This function takes a student's name as input and returns a string that says `"my name is <name>"`.
- **How it works:** It concatenates the string `"my name is "` with the `name` parameter passed into the function and returns the result.

### **3. The `main` Function:**

```go
func main() {
	ScoreA := Grades(84)
	ScoreB := Grades(62)
	ScoreC := Grades(49)
	
	student1 := Students("Goodnight")
	student2 := Students("Manbod")
	student3 := Students("Dukdik")
	
	fmt.Println(student1, ScoreA)
	fmt.Println(student2, ScoreB)
	fmt.Println(student3, ScoreC)
}
```

- **Purpose:** In the `main` function, the `Grades` and `Students` functions are called to:
  1. Calculate the grades for three students based on their scores.
  2. Format their names.
  3. Print out their names and corresponding grades.

- **Variables:**
  - `ScoreA`, `ScoreB`, `ScoreC`: These variables store the grade results for the students based on their scores. 
    - `ScoreA` is calculated using the score `84` (which results in `"grade = A"`).
    - `ScoreB` is calculated using the score `62` (which results in `"grade = C"`).
    - `ScoreC` is calculated using the score `49` (which results in `"grade = F"`).
  
  - `student1`, `student2`, `student3`: These variables store the formatted names of the students using the `Students` function.
    - `student1` holds `"my name is Goodnight"`.
    - `student2` holds `"my name is Manbod"`.
    - `student3` holds `"my name is Dukdik"`.

- **Print Statements:**
  - `fmt.Println(student1, ScoreA)` prints: 
    ```
    my name is Goodnight grade = A
    ```
  - `fmt.Println(student2, ScoreB)` prints:
    ```
    my name is Manbod grade = C
    ```
  - `fmt.Println(student3, ScoreC)` prints:
    ```
    my name is Dukdik grade = F
    ```

### **Summary of Output:**
- The output for each student will show:
  1. Their name.
  2. Their grade based on their score.
  
```
my name is Goodnight grade = A
my name is Manbod grade = C
my name is Dukdik grade = F
```

### **Explanation of the Program's Flow:**
- The program uses functions to handle two main tasks:
  1. **Calculate the grade**: The `Grades` function takes the score and calculates the grade based on the conditions.
  2. **Format the name**: The `Students` function formats the student's name into a sentence.
- After defining these functions, the `main` function calculates and prints the information for three students.
- The program shows that `Goodnight` got an `"A"`, `Manbod` got a `"C"`, and `Dukdik` got an `"F"` based on their respective scores.

### **Key Rules in this Program:**
1. **Using Conditional Logic (`if-else`) to Assign Grades**: 
   - The `Grades` function uses conditional statements to assign grades based on score ranges.
   
2. **String Concatenation for Formatting**: 
   - The `Students` function concatenates a fixed string (`"my name is "`) with the student's name using the `+` operator to return a formatted string.

3. **Function Calls**: 
   - Both functions (`Grades` and `Students`) are used in the `main` function to generate dynamic outputs based on input values.
