This Go program demonstrates the usage of `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements to handle conditional logic. It also shows a short declaration of a variable within an `if` statement and basic conditions to check even/odd numbers and other conditions.

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

### **1. Printing a Header**
```go
fmt.Println("If Else in GoLang")
```
- **Explanation**: This simply prints the title "If Else in GoLang" to the console, acting as a header for the program's output.

### **2. Using If-Else if-Else Statements**
```go
loginCount := 9
var result string

if loginCount < 10 {
    result = "Regular user"
} else if loginCount > 10 {
    result = "Watch out"
} else {
    result = "Exactly 10 login counts"
}

fmt.Println(result)
```
- **Explanation**:
  - **Condition 1**: The program checks if `loginCount` is less than `10`. If it is, the `result` is set to `"Regular user"`.
  - **Condition 2**: If `loginCount` is not less than `10`, it checks if it is greater than `10`. If this condition is true, the `result` is set to `"Watch out"`.
  - **Else**: If neither of the previous conditions is true (i.e., `loginCount` is exactly `10`), the `result` is set to `"Exactly 10 login counts"`.
  - After evaluating the conditions, the program prints the value of `result`.

For `loginCount := 9`, the condition `loginCount < 10` is true, so the output will be:
```
Regular user
```

### **3. Checking if a Number is Even or Odd**
```go
if 9%2 == 0 {
    fmt.Println("Number is even")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Number is odd")
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The program checks if `9 % 2 == 0`. The modulo operator `%` returns the remainder when `9` is divided by `2`.
  - Since `9 % 2 == 1` (there is a remainder), the number is odd, so the program will print `"Number is odd"`.

### **4. Short Variable Declaration in an If Statement**
```go
if num := 3; num < 10 {
    fmt.Println("Num is less than 10")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Num is not less than 10")
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This is an example of a short declaration statement used within an `if` condition:
    - `num := 3` declares and initializes the variable `num` within the `if` statement.
    - The program then checks if `num < 10`. Since `num` is `3`, which is less than `10`, it prints `"Num is less than 10"`.
  - This is a shorthand way of declaring a variable and using it immediately within the scope of the `if` statement.

### **5. Output of the Program**
For the values used in the program:
1. `loginCount := 9`: Since `9 < 10`, the output will be `"Regular user"`.
2. The number `9` is odd, so it will print `"Number is odd"`.
3. `num := 3`: Since `3 < 10`, it will print `"Num is less than 10"`.

### **Final Output**:
```
If Else in GoLang
Regular user
Number is odd
Num is less than 10
```

### **Summary of Key Concepts**:
1. **If-Else Statements**: Used for conditional checks and branching based on different conditions.
   - The `else if` and `else` clauses allow you to check multiple conditions in a sequence.
   - The `else` clause is executed if none of the previous conditions is true.
   
2. **Modulo Operator (`%`)**: Used to check the remainder when dividing a number.
   - `9 % 2 == 1` checks if the number is odd, since the remainder is `1`.

3. **Short Variable Declaration in `if`**: This is a compact way to declare and use a variable in a conditional statement:
   - `if num := 3; num < 10` declares `num` and uses it immediately for comparison in the `if` condition.

4. **Program Flow**: 
   - The program evaluates conditions in order, and if one is true, it executes the corresponding code block. If none are true, the `else` block executes.
