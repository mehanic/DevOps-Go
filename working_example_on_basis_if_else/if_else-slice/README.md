Let's break down and explain the code step-by-step:

### **Code Breakdown:**

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	// List of banned users
	bannedUsers := []string{"andrew", "carolina", "david"}

	// User to check
	user := "marie"

	// Check if the user is in the banned list
	isBanned := false
	for _, bannedUser := range bannedUsers {
		if strings.EqualFold(user, bannedUser) {
			isBanned = true
			break
		}
	}

	// Print message if the user is not banned
	if !isBanned {
		fmt.Printf("%s, you can post a response if you wish.\n", strings.Title(user))
	}
}
```

### **Step-by-step Explanation:**

1. **Imports:**
   - `fmt` is imported for formatted output (using `fmt.Printf`).
   - `strings` is imported to use string-related functions, specifically `strings.EqualFold` and `strings.Title`.

2. **List of Banned Users:**
   ```go
   bannedUsers := []string{"andrew", "carolina", "david"}
   ```
   - This line creates a slice of strings containing the names of banned users (`andrew`, `carolina`, and `david`).

3. **User to Check:**
   ```go
   user := "marie"
   ```
   - This defines the user whose ban status is being checked. In this case, it's `"marie"`.
   
4. **Checking If the User Is Banned:**
   ```go
   isBanned := false
   for _, bannedUser := range bannedUsers {
       if strings.EqualFold(user, bannedUser) {
           isBanned = true
           break
       }
   }
   ```
   - The `isBanned` variable is initially set to `false`.
   - The `for` loop iterates through each `bannedUser` in the `bannedUsers` slice.
   - `strings.EqualFold(user, bannedUser)` compares the `user` with each `bannedUser`, **ignoring case** (so it doesn't matter whether the letters are uppercase or lowercase). If there's a match, `isBanned` is set to `true` and the loop is broken using `break` (since there's no need to check further once the user is found in the list).
   
   - For the `user = "marie"`:
     - `strings.EqualFold("marie", "andrew")` returns `false` (no match).
     - `strings.EqualFold("marie", "carolina")` returns `false` (no match).
     - `strings.EqualFold("marie", "david")` returns `false` (no match).
   
   Since there is no match, the `isBanned` variable remains `false`.

5. **Printing the Result:**
   ```go
   if !isBanned {
       fmt.Printf("%s, you can post a response if you wish.\n", strings.Title(user))
   }
   ```
   - After the loop, the program checks if `isBanned` is `false` using `if !isBanned`.
   - Since `isBanned` is `false`, the message is printed: 
     ```plaintext
     Marie, you can post a response if you wish.
     ```
   - `strings.Title(user)` is used to capitalize the first letter of the user's name. In this case, it converts `"marie"` to `"Marie"`, so the message is printed with the capitalized name.

### **Summary of Rules:**

- **Case-insensitive Comparison:** `strings.EqualFold(user, bannedUser)` allows case-insensitive comparison between the `user` and `bannedUser`. So, `"Marie"` and `"marie"` are considered equal.
- **Looping through the List:** The `for` loop iterates through each banned user in the list and checks if the `user` matches any banned user.
- **Setting `isBanned`:** If the user is found in the list, `isBanned` is set to `true`, otherwise it remains `false`.
- **Printing the Message:** If the user is **not** banned (`!isBanned`), a message is printed allowing them to post a response, with their name capitalized using `strings.Title(user)`.

### **Example Output:**
Since `"marie"` is not in the banned list, the output will be:
```plaintext
Marie, you can post a response if you wish.
```

### **Conclusion:**
This code checks if a given user is in a list of banned users, and if not, prints a message allowing them to post a response, with their name properly capitalized. The check is case-insensitive, meaning the comparison works regardless of whether the letters are uppercase or lowercase.
