In the provided Go code, you have multiple examples that demonstrate variable scoping in Go, especially the behavior of variables declared inside `if` statements and how they interact with variables in other scopes. Here's a detailed explanation of each main function:

### **1. `main` function (first one)**

```go
n, err := strconv.Atoi("42")

if err == nil {
    fmt.Println("There was no error, n is", n)
}
```
- **Explanation:**
  - `strconv.Atoi("42")` converts the string `"42"` to an integer. It returns two values: `n` (the converted integer) and `err` (an error).
  - `err == nil` checks if the conversion was successful (no error).
  - If `err` is `nil`, the program prints `"There was no error, n is 42"`.
  
  **Key Point**: The variables `n` and `err` are available within the scope of the `if` statement where they were declared.

### **2. `main1` function**

```go
if n, err := strconv.Atoi("42"); err == nil {
    fmt.Println("There was no error, n is", n)
}

// n and err are not available here
// fmt.Println(n, err)
```
- **Explanation:**
  - The `n` and `err` variables are declared inside the `if` condition with the statement `n, err := strconv.Atoi("42")`. These variables are **only** available inside the `if` block.
  - After the `if` statement, trying to access `n` and `err` will result in an error because they are scoped only to that `if` block.
  
  **Key Point**: Variables declared in an `if` statement are only available within the scope of that `if` block. They cannot be accessed outside of it.

### **3. `main2` function**

```go
if a := os.Args; len(a) != 2 {
    fmt.Println("Give me a number.")
} else if n, err := strconv.Atoi(a[1]); err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Cannot convert %q.\n", a[1])
} else {
    fmt.Printf("%s * 2 is %d\n", a[1], n*2)
}

// a, n and err are not available here
// they belong to the if statement
// fmt.Println(a, n, err)
```
- **Explanation:**
  - The variable `a` is declared in the first `if` statement as `a := os.Args`. It is available only in the scope of the `if` and `else if` conditions.
  - If the length of `a` is not `2`, the program prints `"Give me a number."`.
  - If the length is `2`, it tries to convert `a[1]` (the argument passed to the program) into an integer. If the conversion is successful, it multiplies the number by 2 and prints the result.
  
  **Key Point**: Just like in the previous examples, `a`, `n`, and `err` are available only within the block of their respective `if` and `else if` statements. They can't be accessed outside of them.

### **4. `main3` function**

```go
if a := os.Args; len(a) != 2 {
    fmt.Println("Give me a number.")
} else if n, err := strconv.Atoi(a[1]); err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Cannot convert %q.\n", a[1])
} else {
    fmt.Printf("%s * 2 is %d\n", a[1], n*2)
}

// n here belongs to the main func
// not to the if statement above

// fmt.Printf("n is %d. ðŸ‘» ðŸ‘» ðŸ‘» - you've been shadowed ;-)\n", n)
```
- **Explanation:**
  - In this function, the variable `a` is again declared inside the first `if` statement. But now, the comment hints at shadowing a variable `n` declared in the main function's scope.
  - When the program gets to the `else if` block, `n` is declared and used to store the result of `strconv.Atoi(a[1])`. However, this `n` **shadows** the `n` declared outside of the `if` statement.
  - The comment hints at the issue: if `n` were declared outside, its value would be "shadowed" by the new `n` inside the `else if`.
  
  **Key Point**: **Shadowing** happens when a variable declared inside a block (like `if` or `else if`) hides a variable with the same name from an outer scope.

### **5. `main4` function**

```go
var (
    n   int
    err error
)

if a := os.Args; len(a) != 2 {
    fmt.Println("Give me a number.")
} else if n, err = strconv.Atoi(a[1]); err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Cannot convert %q.\n", a[1])
} else {
    n *= 2
    fmt.Printf("%s * 2 is %d\n", a[1], n)
}

// if statement has calculated the result using the main func's n variable
fmt.Println("n is", n)
```
- **Explanation:**
  - Here, `n` and `err` are declared outside of the `if` statement (at the beginning of the function). Inside the `if` statement, `n` and `err` are assigned values (using the `=` operator, which means we're modifying the already declared variables).
  - This assignment makes the `n` and `err` variables inside the `if` statement refer to the ones declared outside.
  - After the `if` block finishes, the value of `n` persists in the main function's scope, and the program prints the final value of `n`.

  **Key Point**: If a variable is declared outside of the `if` statement and is assigned a value inside the `if`, the variable will retain the value outside the `if` block. This avoids shadowing and makes the value of the variable accessible outside the `if` block.

### **Summary of Key Concepts:**
1. **Variable Scoping in `if` statements**: Variables declared within an `if` or `else` condition are **only available within that block**. You can't access them outside of the block.
   
2. **Shadowing**: If you declare a variable inside a block (such as `if`, `else`, or `else if`) with the same name as a variable in the outer scope, the inner variable will **shadow** the outer one, meaning the outer variable will be hidden while inside that block.
   
3. **Using `=` for Assignment**: When assigning a value to a variable declared outside the block, you use the `=` operator. This modifies the existing variable, rather than creating a new one.

4. **Persistent Variables**: If a variable is declared outside a block and updated inside that block (using `=`), the updated value persists outside the block.

### **Expected Output:**
The `main4` function, when executed with a valid number as a command-line argument (e.g., `6`), would produce:

```
6 * 2 is 12
n is 12
```

This is because `n` is updated inside the `if` block, and its updated value is available after the block.
