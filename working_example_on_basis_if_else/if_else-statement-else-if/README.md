Let's break down the code step by step to explain the rules of the conditional statements in Go.

### **Code Breakdown:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	fmt.Println()

	if true {
		fmt.Println("here ran")
	}

	if false {
		fmt.Println("there did not run")
	}

	fmt.Println()

	b := true
	if foo := "initialize"; b {
		fmt.Println(foo) // foo only exist here
	}
	// fmt.Println(foo) // foo is not exist here

	fmt.Println()

	c := 3
	if c == 1 {
		fmt.Println("if")
	} else if c == 2 {
		fmt.Println("else if")
	} else if c == 3 {
		fmt.Println("could have many else-if after if")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("else")
	}
	fmt.Println()

	if c == 1 {
		fmt.Println("if")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("could only one else after if")
	}
	fmt.Println()
}
```

### **Explanation of Each Part:**

#### 1. **First `if` Statement:**
```go
if true {
    fmt.Println("here ran")
}
```
- **Condition:** `true` (a constant boolean value, always true).
- **Result:** Since the condition is always true, the block inside the `if` statement runs, and it prints:
  ```
  here ran
  ```

#### 2. **Second `if` Statement:**
```go
if false {
    fmt.Println("there did not run")
}
```
- **Condition:** `false` (a constant boolean value, always false).
- **Result:** Since the condition is false, the block inside the `if` statement does **not** execute, and nothing is printed from this block.

#### 3. **Using Short Variable Declaration Inside `if`:**
```go
b := true
if foo := "initialize"; b {
    fmt.Println(foo) // foo only exists here
}
// fmt.Println(foo) // foo is not exist here
```
- **Short Variable Declaration:** `foo := "initialize"` is a **short variable declaration**. This creates the variable `foo` and initializes it with the value `"initialize"`.
- **Condition:** `b` is `true`.
- **Result:** Since `b` is `true`, the block inside the `if` statement is executed. `foo` exists only within this block. When the `fmt.Println(foo)` line is executed, it prints:
  ```
  initialize
  ```

- **Note:** The line `fmt.Println(foo)` outside the `if` block is commented out. If it were uncommented, it would cause a **compile-time error** because `foo` is out of scope and no longer exists outside the `if` block.

#### 4. **Multiple `else if` Statements:**
```go
c := 3
if c == 1 {
    fmt.Println("if")
} else if c == 2 {
    fmt.Println("else if")
} else if c == 3 {
    fmt.Println("could have many else-if after if")
} else {
    fmt.Println("else")
}
```
- **Condition:** `c == 3` (since `c` is `3`).
- **Flow:**
  - The first condition (`c == 1`) is false, so it moves to the `else if`.
  - The second condition (`c == 2`) is also false, so it moves to the next `else if`.
  - The third condition (`c == 3`) is **true**, so the program executes the block and prints:
    ```
    could have many else-if after if
    ```

#### 5. **`if` and `else` with One Condition:**
```go
if c == 1 {
    fmt.Println("if")
} else {
    fmt.Println("could only one else after if")
}
```
- **Condition:** `c == 1` (but `c` is actually `3`).
- **Flow:** Since `c` is not `1`, the condition is **false** and it falls to the `else` block, printing:
  ```
  could only one else after if
  ```

### **Key Rules in the Code:**

1. **`if` statement**: It is used to check a condition. If the condition evaluates to `true`, the code inside the `if` block is executed.
   
2. **`else if` statement**: This allows for multiple conditions to be checked. If the previous `if` or `else if` condition is false, the next `else if` is evaluated. This helps in handling multiple conditions.

3. **`else` statement**: This provides a default block of code to be executed when all preceding conditions (`if` and `else if`) are false.

4. **Short variable declarations**: Inside an `if` statement, you can use a short variable declaration (e.g., `foo := "initialize"`). The variable declared this way only exists within the scope of that `if` block.

5. **Scope of variables**: Variables declared in an `if` block (using short declaration syntax) are not accessible outside the block.

6. **Multiple `else if` statements**: You can have many `else if` conditions after an `if`. The program will check them in order and execute the first block that is true.

7. **`else` is the last condition**: After an `if` or `else if` block, you can only have **one** `else` block. It runs when none of the previous conditions are true.

### **Output Explanation:**
- The first `if` block prints: `here ran`.
- The second `if` block is skipped since the condition is false.
- The `foo` variable is printed as `initialize` because it is initialized inside an `if` block and the condition (`b == true`) is true.
- The `else if` and `else` conditions evaluate to true for `c == 3`, and print `"could have many else-if after if"`.
- Finally, the program prints `"could only one else after if"` because `c != 1`.

### **Final Output:**
```
here ran

initialize

could have many else-if after if

could only one else after if
```
