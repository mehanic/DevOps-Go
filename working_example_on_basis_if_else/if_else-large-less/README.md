In this Go program, we are using conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, and `else`) to compare the values of variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. Let's break down the rules and flow:

### **Initial Values:**

- `a = 0`
- `b = 1`
- `c = 1`

### **Conditional Logic:**

The `if` statement checks conditions in the following sequence:

1. **First condition: `if a > b`**

   ```go
   if a > b {
       println("a>b")
   }
   ```

   - The first `if` condition checks whether `a` is greater than `b`. 
   - Since `a = 0` and `b = 1`, the condition `a > b` is **false** because `0` is not greater than `1`.
   - Since this condition is false, the program skips the block of code inside this `if` and moves to the next `else if` statement.

2. **Second condition: `else if a > c`**

   ```go
   else if a > c {
       println("a>c")
   }
   ```

   - The `else if` statement checks whether `a` is greater than `c`. 
   - Since `a = 0` and `c = 1`, the condition `a > c` is **false** because `0` is not greater than `1`.
   - Since this condition is also false, the program skips the block of code inside this `else if` and moves to the `else` block.

3. **Else block:**

   ```go
   else {
       println("a < ...")
   }
   ```

   - Since both the `if` and `else if` conditions were false, the program executes the `else` block.
   - The `else` block runs when none of the previous conditions are true.
   - The program will print: `a < ...`

### **Final Output:**

- The output of the program will be:

```
a < ...
```

### **Summary of Flow:**

1. The program checks if `a > b`. Since this is false, it moves to the next condition.
2. It checks if `a > c`. Since this is also false, it moves to the `else` block.
3. Since neither of the previous conditions were true, it executes the code inside the `else` block, printing `a < ...`.

### **Key Takeaways:**

- The conditions are evaluated in order, and once a true condition is found, the corresponding block of code is executed. After that, the remaining conditions are ignored.
- The `else` block will always execute if none of the prior conditions (`if` or `else if`) are true.
