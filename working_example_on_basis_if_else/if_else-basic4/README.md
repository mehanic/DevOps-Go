Let's break down and explain the rules and logic of the Go program you've shared. This program is designed to calculate the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of two numbers, which is often denoted as **EKUK** in Turkish (En Küçük Ortak Kat).

### Key Concept: **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**

The **LCM** of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers. A formula that relates the LCM to the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers is:

\[
\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
\]

This formula suggests that to calculate the LCM, you can divide the product of the two numbers by their GCD.

### Function `EKUK(a, b int) int`

The function `EKUK` is intended to compute the **LCM** of two integers `a` and `b`.

#### 1. **Variable Initialization**:
```go
var ekub, min, i int = 1, 0, 2
```
- **Explanation**:
  - `ekub` is initialized to `1`. This will hold the value of the **GCD** (Greatest Common Divisor), but it is actually being used to store the product of the common divisors.
  - `min` will store the smaller of the two numbers (`a` and `b`).
  - `i` starts at `2`. This is the divisor, and it will be incremented to check all possible divisors.

#### 2. **Find the Smaller Number**:
```go
if a < b {
    min = a
} else {
    min = b
}
```
- **Explanation**: This block compares `a` and `b` and assigns the smaller value to `min`. The reason for this is that the LCM can't be smaller than the largest of the two numbers, so the iteration only needs to go up to the smaller of the two numbers.

#### 3. **Loop to Find Common Divisors (GCD)**:
```go
for min > 1 {
    if a%i == 0 && b%i == 0 {
        ekub *= i
    }
    min /= i
    i++
}
```
- **Explanation**: This loop is intended to check all potential common divisors of `a` and `b`, starting from `i = 2` (the first prime number).
  - The condition `if a%i == 0 && b%i == 0` checks if both `a` and `b` are divisible by `i`. If they are, `ekub` is multiplied by `i` (accumulating the common divisors).
  - `min /= i` reduces `min` by dividing it by `i`. This part is meant to help limit the search space for divisors, but it doesn't work properly for finding the GCD. This logic is incorrect for calculating GCD as it doesn't properly handle the divisors.
  - `i++` increments `i` to check the next potential divisor.

#### 4. **Calculate the LCM**:
```go
ekuk := a * b / ekub
```
- **Explanation**: After calculating the GCD (stored in `ekub`), the function calculates the **LCM** using the formula:
  
\[
\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
\]

Here, the LCM is computed by multiplying `a` and `b` and dividing the result by `ekub`, which is the greatest common divisor (although `ekub` is not calculated correctly here).

#### 5. **Return the Result**:
```go
return ekuk
```
- **Explanation**: The function returns the calculated LCM, which is stored in `ekuk`.

### Main Function:
```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println(EKUK(7, 9))
}
```
- **Explanation**: The `main` function calls `EKUK(7, 9)` to compute the LCM of `7` and `9` and prints the result.

### Issues and Improvements:

1. **Incorrect GCD Calculation**:
   - The logic for finding the GCD (in the loop) is flawed. It does not correctly compute the GCD of two numbers. The GCD should be calculated using the **Euclidean algorithm**, or by using a method to find the common divisors and their product.
   
2. **Incorrect Use of `min /= i`**:
   - The `min /= i` line is incorrect for both calculating the GCD and for limiting the divisor space. This will not work for finding common divisors of `a` and `b`.

### Corrected Version of `EKUK` Function Using the Euclidean Algorithm:

To calculate the **LCM** properly, we should calculate the **GCD** first and then use it to compute the LCM.

Here’s how you can fix it:

```go
func GCD(a, b int) int {
    for b != 0 {
        a, b = b, a % b
    }
    return a
}

func EKUK(a, b int) int {
    gcd := GCD(a, b)
    return a * b / gcd
}
```

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:

1. **GCD Calculation (Euclidean Algorithm)**: The function `GCD(a, b)` computes the **Greatest Common Divisor** using the Euclidean algorithm. This algorithm works by repeatedly replacing `a` with `b` and `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (`a % b`), until `b` becomes `0`. At that point, `a` contains the GCD.

2. **LCM Calculation**: Once we have the GCD, we can calculate the LCM using the formula:
   \[
   \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
   \]

3. **Main Function**: The `main` function calls `EKUK(7, 9)`, which will now correctly compute the LCM of `7` and `9`, which is `63`.

### Example:

For `EKUK(7, 9)`:
- The GCD of `7` and `9` is `1` (because 7 and 9 are coprime).
- The LCM of `7` and `9` is:
  \[
  \text{LCM}(7, 9) = \frac{7 \times 9}{1} = 63
  \]

### Summary of Key Points:
- **LCM (Least Common Multiple)**: The smallest positive integer that is divisible by both `a` and `b`.
- **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)**: The largest integer that divides both `a` and `b` without leaving a remainder.
- The formula to compute the LCM using the GCD is:
  \[
  \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
  \]
- The original code had issues in the calculation of the GCD, which affected the LCM result. By using the **Euclidean algorithm** to compute the GCD, we can fix the issue and correctly calculate the LCM.
