Let's break down the Go code and explain the behavior of the program step by step.

### Code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

// spam function in Go with special default value handling
func spam(a int, b *int) {
	if b == nil {
		fmt.Println("No b value supplied")
	} else {
		fmt.Println(a, *b)
	}
}

func main() {
	// Call spam with no second argument
	spam(1, nil)

	// Call spam with a second argument
	b := 2
	spam(1, &b)
}
```

### **Explanation:**

#### **1. Function Definition:**
```go
func spam(a int, b *int) {
    if b == nil {
        fmt.Println("No b value supplied")
    } else {
        fmt.Println(a, *b)
    }
}
```

- The function `spam` accepts two parameters:
  - `a` is an integer (`int`).
  - `b` is a pointer to an integer (`*int`), meaning it can hold the address of an integer value.

- The function checks whether `b` is `nil`. 
  - If `b` is `nil`, it prints `"No b value supplied"`.
  - If `b` is not `nil`, it dereferences `b` (i.e., `*b`) to access the value it points to and prints both `a` and the value pointed to by `b`.

#### **2. First Function Call:**
```go
spam(1, nil)
```

- In this call:
  - The first argument (`a`) is `1`.
  - The second argument (`b`) is `nil`, which means no pointer to an integer is supplied.
  
- Inside the `spam` function:
  - The `if b == nil` condition is true because `b` is `nil`.
  - So, it prints `"No b value supplied"`.

#### **3. Second Function Call:**
```go
b := 2
spam(1, &b)
```

- In this call:
  - The first argument (`a`) is `1`.
  - The second argument (`b`) is a pointer to an integer (`&b`). Here, `&b` is the address of the variable `b`, which holds the value `2`.
  
- Inside the `spam` function:
  - The `if b == nil` condition is false because `b` now points to a valid memory location (the address of `b`).
  - Therefore, it prints the value of `a` (which is `1`) and the value stored at the address pointed to by `b` (which is `2`). Since `b` is pointing to `2`, the function prints `"1 2"`.

### **Summary of Execution:**

1. **First Call: `spam(1, nil)`**
   - `a` is `1`.
   - `b` is `nil` (no value supplied).
   - The program prints: `"No b value supplied"`.

2. **Second Call: `spam(1, &b)`**
   - `a` is `1`.
   - `b` is a pointer to `b`, where `b` holds the value `2`.
   - The program prints: `"1 2"`.

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Pointers in Go (`*int`):**
   - In Go, `*int` means a pointer to an integer. It holds the memory address of an integer variable, and the `*` operator is used to dereference the pointer (access the value stored at the memory address).
   - The address of a variable `b` is obtained using the `&` operator, like `&b`.

2. **Nil Pointers:**
   - A `nil` pointer does not point to any valid memory address. In Go, a `nil` pointer can be checked with an `if b == nil` condition, and it is commonly used to indicate that no valid value has been passed.
   - If a pointer is `nil`, dereferencing it (i.e., accessing the value it points to) would cause a runtime error, but in this case, the program handles it by checking if the pointer is `nil` before trying to dereference it.

3. **Conditional Logic (if-else):**
   - The `if-else` statement checks whether `b` is `nil`. If it is, it prints `"No b value supplied"`. If it is not `nil`, it dereferences `b` and prints both `a` and the value pointed to by `b`.

### **Output:**

```
No b value supplied
1 2
```

### **Conclusion:**
- The `spam` function is designed to handle cases where the second argument may be `nil`, and it behaves differently based on whether a valid pointer is supplied.
- The first function call prints `"No b value supplied"` because `nil` was passed as the second argument.
- The second function call prints `"1 2"` because `&b` (the pointer to `b`) was passed, and `b` held the value `2`.
