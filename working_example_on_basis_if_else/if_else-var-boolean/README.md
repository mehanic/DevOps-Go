Let's break down the Go code and explain the rules step by step:

### Code:

```go
package main

func main() {
	//a := 3
	//s := "hello world"
	//f := 3.4
	//b := false
	//false->ложь(0), true->истина(1)
	a := 10
	b := 4
	e := 10
	if a > b {
		println("true")
		println("1234")
		e = 4
		l := 10
		println(e + l)
	} else {
		println("false")
	}
	println(e)
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Variable Initialization:**
   ```go
   a := 10
   b := 4
   e := 10
   ```
   - `a` is assigned the value `10`.
   - `b` is assigned the value `4`.
   - `e` is assigned the value `10`.

2. **If Statement:**
   ```go
   if a > b {
       println("true")
       println("1234")
       e = 4
       l := 10
       println(e + l)
   } else {
       println("false")
   }
   ```
   - The program checks if `a > b`, which means checking if `10 > 4`. This condition is **true**.
   - Because the condition is true, the code inside the `if` block is executed:
     - `println("true")` prints `"true"`.
     - `println("1234")` prints `"1234"`.
     - `e = 4` assigns the value `4` to `e` (so now `e` is `4`).
     - `l := 10` declares a local variable `l` and assigns it the value `10`.
     - `println(e + l)` calculates the sum of `e` (which is now `4`) and `l` (which is `10`), and prints the result: `14`.

3. **Else Block:**
   - The `else` block would have executed if `a > b` had been false. However, since `a > b` is true, the `else` block is **skipped**.

4. **Final Print Statement:**
   ```go
   println(e)
   ```
   - After exiting the `if-else` structure, the value of `e` is printed. Since `e` was changed to `4` inside the `if` block, the value `4` is printed.

### **Summary of Execution Flow:**
- The `if` condition `a > b` is true, so the program prints:
  ```
  true
  1234
  14
  ```
- The `else` block is skipped because the `if` condition was true.
- Finally, `e` is printed, which is now `4`.

### **Output:**
```
true
1234
14
4
```

### **Important Points:**
1. **Variable Scope:**
   - The variable `l` is **local** to the `if` block. It is only accessible within the `if` block.
   - The variable `e` is modified inside the `if` block, so its value is changed from `10` to `4` by the end of the `if` block.
   - The final print statement prints the **final value of `e`**, which is `4`.

2. **Flow of Execution:**
   - The program evaluates the `if` condition first. Since `a > b` is true, it executes the `if` block and skips the `else`.
   - It modifies `e` within the `if` block, then prints `e` after the block, reflecting the modified value.

### **Conclusion:**
- The program executes the `if` block, prints specific values, and finally prints the modified value of `e` outside the `if` block.
