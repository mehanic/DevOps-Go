Let's break down the code and explain the rules of the conditional check:

### **Code Breakdown:**

```go
package main

func main() {
	a := 3
	b := 4
	c := 7

	// Check if a is greater than b or a is greater than c
	if a > b || a > c {
		println("a is max")  // If the condition is true, print "a is max"
	} else {
		println("a is not max")  // If the condition is false, print "a is not max"
	}
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `a := 3` assigns the value `3` to the variable `a`.
   - `b := 4` assigns the value `4` to the variable `b`.
   - `c := 7` assigns the value `7` to the variable `c`.

2. **Conditional Statement (`if`):**
   - The condition inside the `if` statement is:
     ```go
     a > b || a > c
     ```
     This is a logical OR (`||`) operation between two conditions:
     - **`a > b`**: checks if `a` is greater than `b`.
     - **`a > c`**: checks if `a` is greater than `c`.
   
   - **Logical OR (`||`) Operator:**
     - The `||` operator means "logical OR." This operator evaluates to `true` if **either** of the two conditions is true.
     - If **either** `a > b` or `a > c` is true, then the whole condition becomes true, and the code inside the `if` block will execute.

3. **Evaluation of the Condition:**
   - The first condition (`a > b`) checks if `a` (3) is greater than `b` (4). This is **false** because 3 is not greater than 4.
   - The second condition (`a > c`) checks if `a` (3) is greater than `c` (7). This is **false** because 3 is not greater than 7.
   
   Since both conditions are false, the `||` operator will result in **false** (because neither of the conditions is true).

4. **`if` block execution:**
   - Since the condition `a > b || a > c` evaluates to false, the code will move to the `else` block.

5. **Output:**
   - The `else` block executes and prints: `a is not max`.

### **Summary of Rules:**

- The `if` condition checks whether `a` is greater than either `b` or `c`. 
- The logical `||` (OR) operator makes the condition true if **either** one of the conditions (`a > b` or `a > c`) is true. If **both** are false, the condition will evaluate to false.
- Since both `a > b` and `a > c` are false in this case, the code goes to the `else` block, printing `"a is not max"`.

### **Conclusion:**
The condition uses the OR (`||`) operator to check if `a` is greater than at least one of the other two values. In this example, since neither `a > b` nor `a > c` is true, the program prints `"a is not max"`.
