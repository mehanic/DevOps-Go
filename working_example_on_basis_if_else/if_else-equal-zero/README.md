This Go program demonstrates how to check if there is a remainder when dividing one number by another. It uses the modulo (`%`) operator to determine whether the division results in a remainder or not.

### **1. Declaring Variables**
```go
a := 9
b := 3
```
- **Explanation**: 
  - The program defines two integer variables:
    - `a := 9`: The first variable, `a`, is set to 9.
    - `b := 3`: The second variable, `b`, is set to 3.

### **2. Modulo Operation**
```go
if a % b == 0 {
    fmt.Println("остатка нету")
} else {
    fmt.Println("есть остаток")
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The expression `a % b` calculates the remainder when `a` is divided by `b`.
  - `a % b == 0` checks if the remainder of `a` divided by `b` is 0.
    - If the remainder is 0, it means that `a` is divisible by `b` without any remainder.
    - If the remainder is not 0, it means there is a remainder when dividing `a` by `b`.

- **Output Logic**:
  - If `a % b == 0` (i.e., `a` is divisible by `b` with no remainder), the program prints `"остатка нету"` (meaning "no remainder" in Russian).
  - If `a % b != 0` (i.e., there is a remainder), the program prints `"есть остаток"` (meaning "there is a remainder" in Russian).

### **3. Example of Execution**
For the values `a = 9` and `b = 3`:
- `a % b` computes the remainder of `9 ÷ 3`. The remainder is 0 because 9 is evenly divisible by 3.
- Since the condition `a % b == 0` is true, the program will output:
  ```
  остатка нету
  ```

### **Final Output**:
```
остатка нету
```

### **Summary of the Logic**:
1. The program checks if `a` is divisible by `b` using the modulo operator `%`.
2. If there is no remainder (`a % b == 0`), it prints `"остатка нету"` (no remainder).
3. If there is a remainder (`a % b != 0`), it would print `"есть остаток"` (there is a remainder).
   
In this case, since `9 % 3 == 0`, the output is `"остатка нету"`.
