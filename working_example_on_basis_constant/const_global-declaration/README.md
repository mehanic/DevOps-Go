This Go code demonstrates the difference between **typed constants** and **untyped constants**. Here's an explanation of the rules and behaviors illustrated by the code:

### 1. **Untyped Constants** (The Compiler Decides the Type)
```go
const (
    a = 30
    b = 30.3445
    c = "Hello World"
)
```
- **Untyped constants** are constants where the type is **not explicitly defined**. In this case:
  - `a` is assigned the value `30`, which is an integer, but since it is untyped, the Go compiler decides its type based on its usage context.
  - `b` is assigned the value `30.3445`, which is a floating-point number. The Go compiler assigns it the default type of `float64` because constants with decimal points are considered `float64` by default.
  - `c` is assigned the string `"Hello World"`, which is a constant string and will have the type `string`.

**When we print the variables in the `main` function**:
```go
fmt.Println(a)       // Prints 30
fmt.Println(b)       // Prints 30.3445
fmt.Println(c)       // Prints "Hello World"
fmt.Printf("%T\n", a) // Prints "int"
fmt.Printf("%T\n", b) // Prints "float64"
fmt.Printf("%T\n", c) // Prints "string"
```
This produces:
```
un typed constants - compiler decides the type
30
30.3445
Hello World
int
float64
string
```
- **`a`** is inferred by the compiler as `int` because it's a whole number.
- **`b`** is inferred as `float64` because it's a decimal value.
- **`c`** is inferred as `string` because itâ€™s a string literal.

### 2. **Typed Constants** (We Decide the Type)
```go
const (
    d int8    = 40
    e float32 = 40.44
    f string  = "Hey"
)
```
- **Typed constants** are constants where the type is **explicitly specified** by the programmer. In this case:
  - `d` is typed as `int8`, meaning it's an 8-bit signed integer, and its value is `40`.
  - `e` is typed as `float32`, meaning it's a 32-bit floating-point number, and its value is `40.44`.
  - `f` is typed as `string`, and its value is `"Hey"`.

**When we print the variables in the `main` function**:
```go
fmt.Println(d)       // Prints 40
fmt.Println(e)       // Prints 40.44
fmt.Println(f)       // Prints "Hey"
fmt.Printf("%T\n", d) // Prints "int8"
fmt.Printf("%T\n", e) // Prints "float32"
fmt.Printf("%T\n", f) // Prints "string"
```
This produces:
```
Typed constants-we decide the type
40
40.44
Hey
int8
float32
string
```
- **`d`** is explicitly typed as `int8`, so it's printed as `int8`.
- **`e`** is explicitly typed as `float32`, so it's printed as `float32`.
- **`f`** is explicitly typed as `string`, so it's printed as `string`.

### Key Differences between Untyped and Typed Constants:

1. **Untyped Constants**:
   - The **type is determined by the Go compiler** based on the value assigned and how the constant is used in the program.
   - For example, an integer assigned without an explicit type will default to `int`, and a floating-point constant will default to `float64`.
   - Untyped constants are **more flexible** because they can be used in expressions with various types, and Go will implicitly handle the type conversions.

2. **Typed Constants**:
   - The **type is explicitly defined by the programmer**.
   - Typed constants are **strict** about type constraints, meaning you cannot use them where the type is incompatible without an explicit type conversion.
   - For example, if you try to assign a `float64` constant to an `int32` variable, you will get a compile-time error unless you explicitly convert the types.

### Conclusion:
- **Untyped constants** offer flexibility, with the compiler determining the type based on the assigned value, making it easier to use them in different contexts.
- **Typed constants** offer stricter control over the type, ensuring that only specific types can be used, and they cannot implicitly convert to other types without an explicit type conversion.
