This Go program demonstrates **constant declaration and behavior**, **implicit typing**, and **constant arithmetic operations**. Let's go through the key rules and concepts:

---

## **1. String Constant**
```go
const s string = "constant"
```
- A **typed string constant `s`** is defined with the value `"constant"`.
- Constants in Go are evaluated at compile time and cannot be changed during runtime.

---

## **2. Numeric Constant Arithmetic**
```go
const n = 500000000 
const d = 3e20 / n
```
- `n` is a **numeric constant**, which is **untyped by default** and can be assigned to any numeric type.
- `3e20` is scientific notation (equivalent to \(3 \times 10^{20}\)).
- `d` becomes \( \frac{3 \times 10^{20}}{500000000} = 6 \times 10^{11} \).

---

## **3. Conversion to `int64`**
```go
fmt.Println(int64(d)) // 600000000000
```
- `d` is implicitly a `float64` because it involves floating-point arithmetic.
- Explicit conversion to `int64` is required to store it as an integer.

---

## **4. Using `math` Package**
```go
fmt.Println(math.Sin(n)) // -0.28470407323754404
```
- `math.Sin` expects a `float64` argument.
- The untyped constant `n` can be directly used because Go allows untyped constants to be compatible with different types.

---

## **5. Multiple Constants Declaration**
```go
const (
	pi float64 = 3.1415
	e  float64 = 2.7182
)

const (
	k, l = 20, 2000
)
```
- `pi` and `e` are explicitly typed as `float64`.
- `k` and `l` are **untyped constants**, inferred from their values.

---

## **6. Implicit Repetition of Values**
```go
const (
	a = 1
	b
	c
)
```
- `b` and `c` implicitly inherit the value from `a`, so all three constants are assigned the value `1`.

---

## **7. Error Handling for Non-Constant Values**
```go
// var p = "page"
// const badConst = p // Error: const initializer p is not a constant
```
- Constants in Go **must be assigned constant expressions**.
- `p` is a variable, not a constant, so assigning it to a constant `badConst` results in a **compilation error**.

---

## âœ… **Key Takeaways**:
1. **Untyped constants** are flexible and can adapt to different types during assignment.
2. **Constant arithmetic operations** are evaluated at compile time.
3. **Implicit value repetition** allows the reuse of the previous constant's value.
4. **Only constant expressions can be assigned to constants**, not variables.
