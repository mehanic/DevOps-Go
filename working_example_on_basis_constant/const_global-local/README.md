This Go program demonstrates the use of **constants** in Go and highlights a couple of important rules and conventions.

### Rules and Explanations:

1. **Constant Declaration:**
   - Constants in Go are declared using the `const` keyword followed by an identifier (the name of the constant), and its value. 
   - In Go, **constants cannot change** during the execution of a program, i.e., their value is fixed at compile time.

```go
const p = "death & taxes"
```
- Here, the constant `p` is declared with the value `"death & taxes"`.
- The Go compiler automatically determines the type of the constant based on the assigned value. In this case, since the value is a string, `p` is inferred to be of type `string`.

2. **Constant with an Explicit Type:**
   ```go
   const q = 42
   ```
   - Here, `q` is declared with the value `42`. It is an untyped constant because it does not specify a type explicitly.
   - The value `42` will be inferred as an **integer type**, specifically `int` (the default integer type in Go).
   - **Untyped constants** like `q` can be used more flexibly since they can adapt to the type of the context in which they are used. 

3. **Constants Are Unchanging:**
   - A constant in Go is a **simple unchanging value**. 
   - Once a constant is assigned a value, **it cannot be modified**.
   - For example, you cannot reassign a value to `p` or `q` in your program after their initial declaration. If you tried to do so, the Go compiler would raise an error.
   
   Example of **invalid code**:
   ```go
   // This would cause an error
   p = "new value"  // Cannot assign to constant p
   ```

4. **Naming Convention:**
   - By convention, constants in Go are written **in camelCase** or **PascalCase** (first letter capitalized for exported constants). 
   - The convention in the Go language style guide discourages the use of **all uppercase letters** for constant names.
   
   In your example, `p` follows the typical Go style guide by using lowercase letters. This is in contrast to the convention in some other languages (like C or Java), where all constants are typically written in **uppercase**.
   
   For instance, you would usually see constants like `const Pi = 3.14` in Go rather than `const PI = 3.14` (which is more common in languages like C or Java).

5. **Printing Constants:**
   - In the `main` function, the values of `p` and `q` are printed using `fmt.Println()`:
   
   ```go
   fmt.Println("p - ", p)
   fmt.Println("q - ", q)
   ```

   This outputs:
   ```
   p -  death & taxes
   q -  42
   ```

   - The values of constants are printed in the same way as variables, and the constants are **evaluated and substituted** directly into the output when the program is run.

### Output of the Program:
```
p -  death & taxes
q -  42
```

### Key Takeaways:
- Constants in Go have fixed values that cannot change after they are set.
- They can be typed or untyped (i.e., the type can be inferred).
- Constants must be **initialized** when they are declared.
- The convention for naming constants in Go typically uses **camelCase** or **PascalCase**, avoiding the all-uppercase style commonly used in other languages.
- **Constants** are very useful when you want to use a value that doesn't change throughout the program and can provide more clarity and maintainability by ensuring these values are immutable.
