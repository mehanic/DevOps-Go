### Explanation of the Go Code

This Go code demonstrates the use of a **ticker** for periodic actions and shows how to use a **channel** (`done`) to gracefully stop a goroutine. It introduces **select** to listen to multiple channels concurrently. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Key Components:

1. **`time.NewTicker(1 * time.Second)`**:
   - This creates a **ticker** that sends the current time on its channel (`ticker.C`) at intervals of **1 second** (`1 * time.Second`).
   - The ticker continues to send an event on `ticker.C` every second until it's stopped.

2. **`done := make(chan struct{})`**:
   - A **channel** named `done` is created using `make(chan struct{})`. This channel will be used to signal when to stop the goroutine running the ticker.
   - The `struct{}` is an empty struct and is often used in Go when a channel is meant only for signaling and not for passing data. It's a memory-efficient way of signaling.

3. **Goroutine (`go func() { ... }`)**:
   - A new **goroutine** is started using `go func() { ... }`. This goroutine continuously listens on multiple channels using a `select` statement.
   - **`select`** is used to handle multiple channel operations. It blocks until one of its cases can proceed.
     - **`case <-done:`**: If a message is received from the `done` channel, the goroutine terminates by `return`ing from the function.
     - **`case <-ticker.C:`**: This case waits for a tick (an event) on the `ticker.C` channel. When the ticker sends an event (every 1 second), it executes `log.Println("Hey!")` to log the message.
   - The goroutine will keep running, printing "Hey!" every second, until it receives a signal from the `done` channel.

4. **`time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)`**:
   - The `main` function uses `time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)` to pause execution for **5 seconds**.
   - During this time, the goroutine will continue to receive ticks and print "Hey!" every second.

5. **`ticker.Stop()`**:
   - After 5 seconds, `ticker.Stop()` is called to stop the ticker. This prevents the ticker from sending further events on the `ticker.C` channel.

6. **`done <- struct{}{}`**:
   - This line sends a signal on the `done` channel, notifying the goroutine to stop.
   - The goroutine, which is waiting on `done` using `select`, will receive this signal and exit by returning from its function.

7. **`log.Println("Done")`**:
   - Finally, after the goroutine stops, the main function logs "Done" to indicate that the program has finished its work.

### Flow of Execution:

1. **Ticker Creation**: 
   - `time.NewTicker(1 * time.Second)` creates a ticker that triggers every 1 second and sends the current time on the `ticker.C` channel.

2. **Starting Goroutine**:
   - A new goroutine is created with `go func() { ... }`. Inside the goroutine, a `select` statement listens on two channels:
     - **`done`**: To stop the goroutine.
     - **`ticker.C`**: To handle the periodic tick events from the ticker and print "Hey!" each time.

3. **Sleeping for 5 Seconds**:
   - The main function pauses for 5 seconds using `time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)`. During this time, the goroutine prints "Hey!" every second.

4. **Stopping the Ticker**:
   - After 5 seconds, the `ticker.Stop()` method stops the ticker from sending more events on the `ticker.C` channel.

5. **Signaling Goroutine to Stop**:
   - The `done <- struct{}{}` sends a signal to the `done` channel, instructing the goroutine to terminate. Once the goroutine receives this signal, it exits the loop and stops.

6. **Logging "Done"**:
   - The main function logs "Done" to indicate that the program has completed its execution.

### Key Concepts:

- **`time.NewTicker`**: Creates a ticker that sends events on a channel (`ticker.C`) at fixed intervals (every 1 second in this case).
- **Goroutines**: Concurrent lightweight threads that allow you to perform tasks asynchronously. In this case, the goroutine listens for ticker events and prints the time.
- **Channels**: Used for communication between goroutines. The `done` channel is used to signal when to stop the goroutine.
- **`select`**: A control structure in Go that allows a goroutine to listen for multiple channel operations concurrently. In this case, it listens for either a `done` signal (to stop the goroutine) or a `ticker.C` signal (to print the time).
- **`struct{}`**: The empty struct is used when you don't need to send any data through the channel, only a signal.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: The program uses a channel (`done`) to safely signal the goroutine to stop, ensuring that the ticker and goroutine are properly stopped before the program finishes.

### Example Output:
```
2025/03/26 00:00:01 Hey!
2025/03/26 00:00:02 Hey!
2025/03/26 00:00:03 Hey!
2025/03/26 00:00:04 Hey!
2025/03/26 00:00:05 Hey!
2025/03/26 00:00:06 Done
```

### Important Notes:
- **Concurrency and Synchronization**: This example shows how to run concurrent tasks (ticker and goroutine) in Go. The use of `select` ensures the goroutine listens for multiple conditions without blocking.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: By using the `done` channel, the program ensures that the goroutine stops cleanly when it is no longer needed, preventing any potential issues from an uncontrolled termination.
- **Ticker Stopping**: Calling `ticker.Stop()` stops the ticker and ensures no more ticks are sent after the program has finished its work.
