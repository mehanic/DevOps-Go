### Explanation of the Go Code

This Go program demonstrates how to use `time.Ticker` to execute a task repeatedly at fixed intervals, and it also shows how to stop the ticker after a certain duration.

#### Key Components:

1. **`time.NewTicker(1 * time.Second)`**:
   - The `time.NewTicker(d)` function creates a new ticker that triggers an event every `d` duration (in this case, 1 second).
   - A ticker is a type of timer that repeatedly sends the current time on its channel (`ticker.C`) at the specified interval (1 second in this case).

2. **Goroutine (`go func() {}`)**:
   - The `go` keyword is used to start a new goroutine, which is a lightweight concurrent execution thread in Go. In this case, it's used to run the function that listens for events on the ticker's channel.
   - `for range ticker.C`: This is a `for` loop that listens on `ticker.C`, which is a channel. Each time the ticker ticks (every 1 second), a new event is received on this channel, and the loop executes.
   - Inside the loop, `log.Println("Hey!")` is executed, printing `"Hey!"` every time the ticker ticks.

3. **`time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)`**:
   - The `time.Sleep(d)` function pauses the execution of the program for `d` duration (in this case, 5 seconds).
   - This means the main function will wait for 5 seconds before proceeding to the next line, which allows the ticker to print `"Hey!"` every second for 5 seconds.

4. **`ticker.Stop()`**:
   - After the `time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)`, the `ticker.Stop()` function is called to stop the ticker from firing future events.
   - Stopping the ticker ensures that the program doesn't continue sending events on the ticker channel after the 5 seconds have passed.

### Flow of Execution:

1. **Ticker Creation**: 
   - `time.NewTicker(1 * time.Second)` creates a ticker that triggers every 1 second.

2. **Starting Goroutine**:
   - A new goroutine is launched with the `go` keyword. This goroutine listens on `ticker.C` for events and prints `"Hey!"` to the console every time it receives a tick.

3. **Sleeping for 5 Seconds**:
   - The `time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)` causes the main function to pause for 5 seconds, allowing the ticker to tick 5 times, and print `"Hey!"` each time.

4. **Stopping the Ticker**:
   - After 5 seconds, `ticker.Stop()` is called, which stops the ticker from sending any further events. This stops the `for range ticker.C` loop from continuing and terminates the goroutine.

### Key Concepts:

- **`time.Ticker`**: Used for performing actions at regular intervals.
- **Goroutines**: Lightweight concurrent threads in Go that allow you to execute code concurrently.
- **Channels (`ticker.C`)**: Used to send and receive values between goroutines. The ticker sends the current time on `ticker.C` every second.
- **`time.Sleep`**: Pauses the program's execution for a specified duration, allowing you to control when the ticker should stop.
- **`ticker.Stop()`**: Stops the ticker to prevent it from sending events.

### Example Output:
The program will print `"Hey!"` every second for 5 seconds:
```
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
```

After 5 seconds, the ticker is stopped, and no more messages will be printed.
