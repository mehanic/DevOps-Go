Let's break down the code you provided and explain each part in detail. This Go program demonstrates concurrency and atomic operations to safely modify shared variables.

### Code Explanation:

#### 1. **Importing Required Packages**:

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "sync/atomic"
)
```

- **`fmt`**: The package for formatted I/O operations. It is used here to print the value of `ops` at the end.
- **`sync`**: This package provides synchronization primitives. It is used here for `WaitGroup` to wait for all goroutines to finish.
- **`sync/atomic`**: This package provides low-level atomic memory primitives for safely updating shared variables in concurrent environments.

#### 2. **Main Function**:

```go
func main() {
    var ops uint64
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
```

- **`var ops uint64`**: Declares a variable `ops` of type `uint64` to keep track of the number of operations. It's a shared variable that will be updated by multiple goroutines.
- **`var wg sync.WaitGroup`**: A `WaitGroup` is used to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish executing.

#### 3. **Creating Goroutines**:

```go
for i := 0; i < 50; i++ {
    wg.Add(1)

    go func() {
        for c := 0; c < 1000; c++ {
            atomic.AddUint64(&ops, 1)
        }
        wg.Done()
    }()
}
```

- **`for i := 0; i < 50; i++`**: This loop spawns 50 goroutines.
- **`wg.Add(1)`**: Adds 1 to the `WaitGroup` counter for each goroutine. This keeps track of how many goroutines are running and ensures we wait for them to finish.
- **`go func() { ... }()`**: This creates a new goroutine. The anonymous function runs concurrently with the main function.
    - Inside the goroutine, there's a loop running 1000 times (`for c := 0; c < 1000; c++`).
    - **`atomic.AddUint64(&ops, 1)`**: This is an atomic operation that safely increments the `ops` variable by 1. This ensures that even when multiple goroutines are modifying `ops` at the same time, the operation is safe and no data race occurs. The `atomic.AddUint64` function takes a pointer to the variable and the value to add, and it ensures the operation is done atomically (i.e., without interference from other goroutines).
    - **`wg.Done()`**: Once the goroutine completes its task, `Done()` is called to signal that the goroutine has finished.

#### 4. **Waiting for Goroutines to Finish**:

```go
wg.Wait()
```

- **`wg.Wait()`**: This blocks the main function from proceeding until all the goroutines have finished their work. The `Wait()` function waits for the `WaitGroup` counter to reach 0, which happens when `Done()` is called for each goroutine.

#### 5. **Printing the Result**:

```go
fmt.Println("ops:", ops)
```

- After all 50 goroutines have completed their work, this line prints the value of `ops`. Since each goroutine increments `ops` by 1000, and there are 50 goroutines, the expected output should be `ops: 50000`.

### Key Concepts in the Code:

#### 1. **Goroutines**:
- A goroutine is a lightweight thread of execution. By using `go func() { ... }()`, the program creates 50 goroutines, each executing the same code concurrently.

#### 2. **Atomic Operations**:
- **`atomic.AddUint64(&ops, 1)`**: This operation ensures that the increment of the `ops` variable is done safely in a concurrent environment. Without atomic operations, updating a shared variable like `ops` in multiple goroutines could cause a data race and lead to incorrect results.
- Atomic operations guarantee that the value is updated in an uninterruptible, thread-safe manner.

#### 3. **WaitGroup**:
- The `sync.WaitGroup` is used to wait for all goroutines to finish their execution. The main function calls `wg.Wait()` to block until all 50 goroutines have completed.
- Each goroutine calls `wg.Done()` when it's done, and `wg.Add(1)` is used to increment the counter for each goroutine before it starts.

### What Happens When You Run This Code?

1. **Goroutines Start**: The program starts 50 goroutines, each incrementing `ops` 1000 times.
2. **Atomic Increments**: Each goroutine safely increments `ops` 1000 times using `atomic.AddUint64`.
3. **Waiting for Completion**: The main function waits for all goroutines to finish using `wg.Wait()`.
4. **Result**: After all goroutines are done, the value of `ops` will be `50 * 1000 = 50000` because there were 50 goroutines, and each incremented `ops` 1000 times.

---

### Expected Output:

```bash
ops: 50000
```

This is the total number of increments, and it's guaranteed to be accurate because the atomic operation ensures that each increment is performed without interference from other goroutines.

### Key Takeaways:

- **Concurrency**: The program utilizes goroutines to execute multiple tasks concurrently.
- **Atomic Operations**: The use of `atomic.AddUint64` prevents data races when modifying the shared variable `ops`.
- **Synchronization**: The `sync.WaitGroup` is used to ensure the main function waits until all goroutines have completed their tasks before printing the result.
