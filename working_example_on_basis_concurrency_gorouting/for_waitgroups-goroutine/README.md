Let's break down the code step by step to understand how it works and explain the key concepts involved.

### Code Explanation:

#### 1. **Importing Required Packages**:

```go
import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
    "sync"
)
```

- **`fmt`**: Used for formatted I/O operations, like printing to the console.
- **`time`**: Provides time-related functions, including `time.Sleep` which is used to pause the execution for a specified duration (1 second in this case).
- **`sync`**: Provides synchronization primitives, particularly `sync.WaitGroup` which is used here to ensure that all goroutines have completed before the program exits.

#### 2. **The `worker` Function**:

```go
func worker(id int) {
    fmt.Printf("Worker %d started\n", id)
    time.Sleep(time.Second)
    fmt.Printf("Worker %d done\n", id)
}
```

- **`worker(id int)`**: A function that simulates a task being performed by a worker. It takes an integer `id` which identifies the worker.
- **`fmt.Printf("Worker %d started\n", id)`**: This prints a message indicating that a worker with a specific ID has started.
- **`time.Sleep(time.Second)`**: This pauses the execution of the function for 1 second (simulating some work being done).
- **`fmt.Printf("Worker %d done\n", id)`**: After the sleep, this prints a message indicating that the worker has finished its task.

#### 3. **Main Function**:

```go
func main() {

    var wg sync.WaitGroup
```

- **`var wg sync.WaitGroup`**: A `sync.WaitGroup` named `wg` is created to wait for all goroutines (workers) to finish. The `sync.WaitGroup` keeps track of how many goroutines are still running and allows the main function to wait until all goroutines are done.

#### 4. **Loop to Launch Goroutines**:

```go
    for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {

        wg.Add(1)

        i := i

        go func() {
            defer wg.Done()
            worker(i)
        }()
    }
```

- **`for i := 1; i <= 5; i++`**: This loop will run 5 times, creating 5 workers. Each iteration of the loop launches a new goroutine that will call the `worker` function.
  
- **`wg.Add(1)`**: For each iteration of the loop, `wg.Add(1)` increments the `sync.WaitGroup` counter by 1. This indicates that there is one more goroutine (worker) that the main function needs to wait for.

- **`i := i`**: This line may seem a bit confusing, but it creates a new variable `i` in the goroutine's scope that holds the current value of `i` from the outer loop. This is important to prevent a common mistake in Go known as a "goroutine closure capture" issue.

  - Without this line, all the goroutines would capture the same `i` from the loop, and they would all use the final value of `i` (which would be `5` after the loop finishes). By creating a new variable `i` within the goroutine, we ensure that each goroutine gets its own copy of the value of `i` (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).

- **`go func() { ... }()`**: This starts a new goroutine by launching an anonymous function. Each goroutine executes this anonymous function concurrently.
    - Inside the anonymous function:
        - **`defer wg.Done()`**: This ensures that when the goroutine finishes its work, it signals the `sync.WaitGroup` that it is done by calling `wg.Done()`. This will decrement the `sync.WaitGroup` counter by 1.
        - **`worker(i)`**: This calls the `worker` function, passing the unique worker ID.

#### 5. **Waiting for Goroutines to Finish**:

```go
    wg.Wait()
}
```

- **`wg.Wait()`**: This function call blocks the main function from proceeding until the `sync.WaitGroup` counter reaches 0, meaning all goroutines have completed their tasks. Since we used `wg.Add(1)` for each goroutine, we need to call `wg.Done()` in each goroutine to decrement the counter. Once all goroutines are finished, the main function continues and the program exits.

### Key Concepts:

#### 1. **Goroutines**:
- Goroutines are lightweight threads in Go, and the `go` keyword is used to start a new goroutine. Each worker runs concurrently, meaning they are executed independently, potentially on different CPUs.

#### 2. **Closure in Goroutines**:
- Inside the loop, the statement `i := i` ensures that each goroutine gets its own copy of the loop variable `i`. Without this, all the goroutines would capture the same variable, and they'd all print the same worker ID (which would be the last value of `i`, i.e., 5).

#### 3. **Syncing with `WaitGroup`**:
- The `sync.WaitGroup` is used to ensure that the main function waits for all goroutines to finish before exiting. We call `wg.Add(1)` before launching each goroutine to indicate that we expect one more task to be done. In each goroutine, `wg.Done()` is called when the task is complete. Finally, `wg.Wait()` in the main function waits for all tasks to complete before continuing.

### Expected Output:

The output will show that the workers start and finish their tasks in a non-deterministic order, depending on the scheduler. Here's a possible output:

```
Worker 1 started
Worker 2 started
Worker 3 started
Worker 4 started
Worker 5 started
Worker 1 done
Worker 2 done
Worker 3 done
Worker 4 done
Worker 5 done
```

The exact order of the "started" and "done" messages may vary because the goroutines run concurrently, but the final output will always show that each worker starts and then finishes its task.

---

### Key Takeaways:

- **Concurrency**: Goroutines allow concurrent execution. The program creates 5 concurrent workers that execute in parallel.
- **Goroutine Synchronization**: `sync.WaitGroup` ensures that the main function waits for all goroutines to finish before proceeding.
- **Closures**: The code uses the pattern `i := i` to capture the current value of `i` for each goroutine, preventing issues with goroutine closures.
