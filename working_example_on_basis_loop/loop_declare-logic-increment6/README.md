### Explanation of the Go Program

This Go program demonstrates an **infinite `for` loop** with conditional break and print statements. Here's a breakdown of the code:

---

### 1. **Variable Declaration:**

```go
var i int = 0
```

- This declares an integer variable `i` and initializes it to `0`. This variable will be used as the loop counter.

---

### 2. **Infinite `for` Loop:**

```go
for {
```

- This is an **infinite `for` loop**. Since no condition is provided (i.e., it's empty), the loop will continue indefinitely until a `break` statement or some other exit condition is met.

---

### 3. **First `if` Statement - Breaking the Loop:**

```go
if 7 == i {
    break
}
```

- Inside the loop, there's a condition: if `i` equals `7`, the `break` statement is executed, which exits the loop.
- So, when `i` reaches `7`, the loop will stop.

---

### 4. **Second `if` Statement - Printing the Value of `i`:**

```go
if i <= 10 {
    fmt.Println("loop", i)
}
```

- If `i` is less than or equal to `10`, the program will print the value of `i`.
- This ensures that only values of `i` from `0` to `6` are printed, as the loop stops when `i` reaches `7`.

---

### 5. **Incrementing the Value of `i`:**

```go
i++
```

- After each iteration of the loop, the value of `i` is incremented by `1` (`i++`).
- This continues the loop to the next iteration with the updated value of `i`.

---

### 6. **When the Loop Ends:**

- The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `6`, printing values `0` through `6`.
- When `i` reaches `7`, the `if 7 == i { break }` condition triggers the `break` statement, exiting the loop.

---

### **What the Code Does:**

- The program starts with `i = 0`.
- It enters the infinite `for` loop and starts checking the conditions.
- It prints values of `i` (from 0 to 6) on each iteration.
- When `i` reaches `7`, the program breaks the loop and exits.

---

### **Output:**

```
loop 0
loop 1
loop 2
loop 3
loop 4
loop 5
loop 6
```

- The loop prints the values of `i` from `0` to `6`. When `i` becomes `7`, the loop breaks, and the program stops.

---

### **Key Points:**

1. **Infinite `for` Loop**: The loop has no condition, so it will continue indefinitely unless explicitly stopped.
2. **`break` Statement**: The loop is terminated when `i` equals `7`, using the `break` statement.
3. **Conditionals**: The `if` statements ensure that the value of `i` is printed only when `i` is less than or equal to `10`, and the loop terminates once `i` reaches `7`.

---

### Conclusion:
This program demonstrates an **infinite loop** that uses conditions to print values and break out of the loop. It also shows how to increment a variable and conditionally stop execution when a specific condition is met.
