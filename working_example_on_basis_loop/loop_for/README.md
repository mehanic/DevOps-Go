The code demonstrates three important behaviors in Go's `for` loop: **classic for loop**, **breaking from a loop**, and **continuing in a loop**. Here’s a detailed explanation of each part of the code:

### **1. Classic `for` Loop:**
```go
for i := 1; i < 10; i++ {
	fmt.Println(i)
}
```
- This is the classic form of the `for` loop, commonly used in many programming languages.
- **Components:**
  1. **Initialization (`i := 1`):** Sets the starting value of `i` to 1. This happens before the loop starts.
  2. **Condition (`i < 10`):** The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than 10.
  3. **Post Statement (`i++`):** After each iteration, the value of `i` is incremented by 1.
  
- **Output:** The loop will print the numbers from `1` to `9` because the loop stops before `i` reaches `10`.

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```

### **2. Breaking from a Loop:**
```go
for {
	fmt.Println("We're in the for loop")
	break
}
fmt.Println("Now we're out!")
```
- This is an **infinite loop**. The loop runs continuously because the `for` statement doesn't have a condition (it’s just `for {}`).
- Inside the loop, `fmt.Println("We're in the for loop")` will be printed once.
- The `break` statement is encountered, causing the loop to terminate immediately, even though there was no condition specified to stop the loop.
- After breaking out of the loop, the program will proceed to print `"Now we're out!"`.

**Output:**
```
We're in the for loop
Now we're out!
```

### **3. Continuing in a Loop:**
```go
for n := 0; n <= 10; n++ {
	if n%3 == 0 {
		continue
	}
	fmt.Println(n)
}
```
- This loop iterates through the numbers `0` to `10` (inclusive). The loop variable `n` starts at `0` and increments by 1 until `n` reaches 10.
- The `if n%3 == 0` condition checks if `n` is divisible by 3 (i.e., `n` is a multiple of 3).
  - **When `n` is divisible by 3**, the `continue` statement is executed. This means the current iteration is skipped, and the loop moves on to the next iteration without executing `fmt.Println(n)`.
  - **When `n` is not divisible by 3**, `fmt.Println(n)` is executed and the value of `n` is printed.
  
- **Output:** The numbers printed will be all numbers from `0` to `10` **except** those that are divisible by 3 (`0`, `3`, `6`, and `9`).

**Output:**
```
1
2
4
5
7
8
10
```

### **Summary of Loop Behavior:**
1. **Classic `for` loop:** Iterates a fixed number of times, from `i = 1` to `i = 9` in this case.
2. **Breaking from a loop:** The `break` statement immediately exits the loop, no matter where it is placed in the loop.
3. **Continuing in a loop:** The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and continues with the next iteration of the loop. In this case, it skips the printing of numbers divisible by 3.

### Key Points:
- **`break`** is used to immediately exit a loop.
- **`continue`** skips the current iteration and proceeds with the next iteration of the loop.
- **Infinite loops** can be controlled using `break` or conditional checks within the loop.
