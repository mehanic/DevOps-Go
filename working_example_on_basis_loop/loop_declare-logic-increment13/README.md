### Explanation of the Code:

The code consists of two main functions demonstrating different loop control structures in Go: `break` and `continue`.

---

### **First function (`main`)**:
```go
func main() {
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		fmt.Println("Iteration number", i)
		if i == 5 {
			break // Exit the loop when `i` equals 5
		}
	}

	main1()
}
```

- **Purpose:** This function uses a **`for`** loop to iterate from `0` to `9`. It prints the iteration number during each loop cycle, but when `i` reaches `5`, the loop is **terminated** using the `break` statement.
- **Explanation:**
  - `for i := 0; i < 10; i++`: A `for` loop is initialized with `i = 0` and will run while `i < 10`. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by `1`.
  - `fmt.Println("Iteration number", i)`: Prints the current iteration number.
  - `if i == 5 { break }`: As soon as `i` equals `5`, the `break` statement is executed, causing the loop to exit immediately, even though the loop condition `i < 10` would have allowed more iterations.
- **What happens:**
  - The loop runs and prints the iteration numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and when `i` reaches 5, it stops. So, the printed output will be:
  ```
  Iteration number 0
  Iteration number 1
  Iteration number 2
  Iteration number 3
  Iteration number 4
  Iteration number 5
  ```

After the loop terminates at `i == 5`, the `main1` function is called, which demonstrates another loop.

---

### **Second function (`main1`)**:
```go
func main1() {
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		// If the result is even, skip to the next iteration
		if i%2 == 0 {
			continue
		}
		fmt.Println(i, "is an odd number")
	}
}
```

- **Purpose:** This function uses a **`for`** loop to iterate from `0` to `9` and prints out odd numbers while skipping even numbers. It uses the `continue` statement to skip the even numbers.
- **Explanation:**
  - `for i := 0; i < 10; i++`: A `for` loop runs while `i` is less than `10`, starting from `i = 0` and increasing by `1` in each iteration.
  - `if i%2 == 0 { continue }`: This condition checks if `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`). If the number is even, the `continue` statement is triggered, causing the loop to skip to the next iteration without executing the remaining statements in the loop.
  - `fmt.Println(i, "is an odd number")`: For odd numbers (when `i % 2 != 0`), this line prints the current number and indicates that it is odd.
- **What happens:**
  - The loop skips even numbers and prints only the odd numbers from `1` to `9`. The printed output will be:
  ```
  1 is an odd number
  3 is an odd number
  5 is an odd number
  7 is an odd number
  9 is an odd number
  ```

---

### **Summary of Key Points:**

1. **`break` Statement:**
   - The `break` statement is used to **terminate** the loop immediately. In `main()`, it stops the loop when `i == 5`.

2. **`continue` Statement:**
   - The `continue` statement is used to **skip** the current iteration of the loop and move to the next one. In `main1()`, it skips even numbers and prints only the odd ones.

---

### **Example Outputs:**

1. **From `main()`**:
   ```
   Iteration number 0
   Iteration number 1
   Iteration number 2
   Iteration number 3
   Iteration number 4
   Iteration number 5
   ```

2. **From `main1()`**:
   ```
   1 is an odd number
   3 is an odd number
   5 is an odd number
   7 is an odd number
   9 is an odd number
   ```

This code demonstrates how to control loops with `break` and `continue` to either exit early or skip certain iterations based on conditions.
