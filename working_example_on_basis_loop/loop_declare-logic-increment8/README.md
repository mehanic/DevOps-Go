### Explanation of the Go Program

This Go program demonstrates how to use a **`switch`** statement to map user input (a number) to a specific day of the week. Let's break it down:

---

### 1. **Displaying the Menu:**

```go
fmt.Println("1. Monday \n2. Tuesday \n3. Wednesday \n4. Thursday \n5. Friday \n6. Saturday \n7. Sunday")
```

- This line prints the days of the week along with their corresponding numbers to the console.
  - The `\n` is a newline character, so each day appears on a new line.
  
  **Output:**

  ```
  1. Monday 
  2. Tuesday 
  3. Wednesday 
  4. Thursday 
  5. Friday 
  6. Saturday 
  7. Sunday
  ```

### 2. **Declaring a Variable for User Input:**

```go
var choice int
```

- This line declares an integer variable `choice` which will store the user's choice (the day number they input).

---

### 3. **Prompting the User for Input:**

```go
fmt.Println("Enter a number (1-7) to choose a day:")
fmt.Scanf("%d", &choice)
```

- The first line prints a prompt asking the user to input a number between 1 and 7 to choose a day.
- `fmt.Scanf("%d", &choice)` reads the user input (an integer) and stores it in the variable `choice`. The `"%d"` format specifier is used to read an integer value.

### 4. **Switch Statement:**

```go
switch choice {
case 1:
    fmt.Println("Monday")
case 2:
    fmt.Println("Tuesday")
case 3:
    fmt.Println("Wednesday")
case 4:
    fmt.Println("Thursday")
case 5:
    fmt.Println("Friday")
case 6:
    fmt.Println("Saturday")
case 7:
    fmt.Println("Sunday")
default:
    fmt.Println("Invalid choice! Please enter a number between 1 and 7.")
}
```

- A **`switch`** statement is used here to check the value of `choice` and match it to a specific case. Depending on the user's input, the corresponding day of the week is printed.
  
  **Details:**
  
  - **`case 1:`** If `choice` is `1`, it will print `"Monday"`.
  - **`case 2:`** If `choice` is `2`, it will print `"Tuesday"`, and so on for the other days.
  - **`default:`** If the value of `choice` doesn't match any of the cases (i.e., the user enters a number outside the range 1-7), the program will print the message `"Invalid choice! Please enter a number between 1 and 7."`.

### 5. **Output Example:**

**Scenario 1:**

If the user enters the number `2`:

```
Enter a number (1-7) to choose a day:
2
Tuesday
```

**Scenario 2:**

If the user enters a number that is out of the range 1-7, for example, `10`:

```
Enter a number (1-7) to choose a day:
10
Invalid choice! Please enter a number between 1 and 7.
```

### **Key Points:**

1. **`fmt.Println()`**: This function prints messages or values to the console. In this case, it's used to print both the days of the week and prompts to the user.
   
2. **`fmt.Scanf()`**: This function reads user input and stores it in the variable. Here, it's used to get an integer input from the user.

3. **`switch` statement**: This is used for multiple conditional checks. It evaluates the `choice` variable and compares it with each `case`. If there's a match, the corresponding block of code will execute.

4. **`default` case**: This is used to handle any input that doesn't match any of the cases. It's similar to an `else` in an `if-else` chain and ensures that the program handles invalid or unexpected inputs gracefully.

### **Conclusion:**

This program is a basic example of how to use a **`switch`** statement in Go to handle different conditions based on user input. By mapping numbers to days of the week, it provides a way to convert numerical input into meaningful output, along with a way to handle invalid input.
