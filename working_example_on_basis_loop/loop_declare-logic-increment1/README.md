### **Explanation of the `for` Loop in Go (Countdown Example)**

This Go program demonstrates a **`for` loop** that **counts down** from 100 to 0.

---

### **1. Structure of the `for` Loop**

```go
for num := 100; num >= 0; num -= 1 {
    println(num)
}
```

The `for` loop in Go consists of **three parts**:

1. **Initialization (`num := 100`)**: This initializes the variable `num` to 100. This is the starting point of the loop.
2. **Condition (`num >= 0`)**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `num` is **greater than or equal to 0**.
3. **Post-Iteration (`num -= 1`)**: After each iteration, the value of `num` is **decremented by 1** (i.e., `num` is reduced by 1).

---

### **2. Execution Flow**
| Iteration | `num` Before Loop | Condition (`num >= 0`) | Prints `num` | `num` After Decrement |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| 1         | 100               | ✅ True                 | 100          | 99                     |
| 2         | 99                | ✅ True                 | 99           | 98                     |
| 3         | 98                | ✅ True                 | 98           | 97                     |
| ...       | ...               | ...                    | ...          | ...                    |
| 100       | 1                 | ✅ True                 | 1            | 0                      |
| 101       | 0                 | ✅ True                 | 0            | -1                     |
| 102       | -1                | ❌ False (Loop Stops)   | -            | -                      |

- The loop **stops** when `num == -1` because the condition `num >= 0` is **no longer true**.

---

### **3. Output**
The output will be:

```
100
99
98
97
...
2
1
0
```

The program will **print each value of `num` starting from 100 down to 0**, with each number printed on a new line.

---

### **4. Key Takeaways**

- **Loop starts at `num = 100`** and **counts downwards**.
- **Condition (`num >= 0`)** ensures that the loop continues running while `num` is non-negative.
- **Decrement** happens with `num -= 1` after each iteration, meaning that `num` decreases by 1.
- The loop **stops** when `num` becomes less than 0, as the condition `num >= 0` fails.

---

### **In Summary:**

- This is a **countdown loop** that prints values from 100 to 0.
- The loop uses the **decrement operator** (`num -= 1`) to decrease the value of `num` in each iteration.
- The loop exits once the condition (`num >= 0`) is no longer satisfied.
