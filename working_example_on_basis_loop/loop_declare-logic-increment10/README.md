### Explanation of the Go Program:

This Go program uses a **`for`** loop to print the message `"No more"` followed by numbers from `1` to `5`.

Let's break down the program step by step:

---

### 1. **The `for` Loop:**

```go
for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
    fmt.Println("No more", i)
}
```

This is a basic **`for`** loop in Go. It consists of three parts:

- **Initialization:** `i := 1`  
   This initializes the loop variable `i` with the value `1`. This is the starting point of the loop, and it will begin counting from `1`.

- **Condition:** `i <= 5`  
   This is the condition that is checked before each iteration of the loop. The loop will keep executing as long as this condition is true. In this case, the loop will continue to run as long as `i` is less than or equal to `5`.

- **Post Statement (Increment):** `i++`  
   This is executed after each iteration of the loop. It increments the value of `i` by 1, i.e., `i++` is shorthand for `i = i + 1`.

---

### 2. **Print Statement:**

```go
fmt.Println("No more", i)
```

This line prints the message `"No more"` followed by the current value of `i`. 

- In the first iteration, `i = 1`, so it prints `"No more 1"`.
- In the second iteration, `i = 2`, so it prints `"No more 2"`.
- This continues until the loop ends when `i` reaches `6`.

---

### 3. **Flow of the Program:**

1. The loop starts with `i = 1` (initialization).
2. The condition `i <= 5` is checked, and it is true since `1 <= 5`.
3. The program prints `"No more 1"`.
4. The post statement `i++` increments `i` to `2`.
5. The condition `i <= 5` is checked again, and since `2 <= 5`, the loop continues.
6. The program prints `"No more 2"`, and `i` is incremented to `3`.
7. This continues until `i` becomes `6`, at which point the condition `i <= 5` becomes false.
8. The loop stops.

---

### **Output:**

The output of the program will be:

```
No more 1
No more 2
No more 3
No more 4
No more 5
```

---

### **Summary:**

- **`for` loop:** The program uses a `for` loop with three components: initialization (`i := 1`), condition (`i <= 5`), and post statement (`i++`).
- **Prints `"No more"` followed by a number:** The loop runs 5 times, printing `"No more"` followed by the current value of `i` each time.
- **Stopping condition:** The loop stops when `i` exceeds `5`, because the condition `i <= 5` becomes false.
