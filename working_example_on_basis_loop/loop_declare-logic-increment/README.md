### **Explanation of the `for` Loop in Go**

This Go program demonstrates a **basic `for` loop**.

---

### **1. Structure of the `for` Loop**
```go
for num := 0; num < 10; num += 1 {
    println(num)
}
```
The `for` loop in Go has three parts:
1. **Initialization (`num := 0`)** → Variable `num` is initialized to `0`.
2. **Condition (`num < 10`)** → The loop continues as long as `num` is **less than** `10`.
3. **Increment (`num += 1`)** → After each iteration, `num` is increased by `1`.

---

### **2. Execution Flow**
| Iteration | `num` Before Loop | Condition (`num < 10`) | Prints `num` | `num` After Increment |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| 1         | 0                 | ✅ True                 | 0            | 1                      |
| 2         | 1                 | ✅ True                 | 1            | 2                      |
| 3         | 2                 | ✅ True                 | 2            | 3                      |
| ...       | ...               | ...                    | ...          | ...                    |
| 10        | 9                 | ✅ True                 | 9            | 10                     |
| 11        | 10                | ❌ False (Loop Stops)   | -            | -                      |

- The loop **stops** when `num == 10`, because the condition `num < 10` is **no longer true**.

---

### **3. Output**
```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
```
Each value of `num` is printed on a new line.

---

### **4. Key Takeaways**
✅ **Go's `for` loop is similar to C, Java, and JavaScript**.  
✅ **The loop runs until the condition (`num < 10`) is false**.  
✅ **Increment (`num += 1`) updates the variable in each iteration**.  
✅ **`println(num)` prints each value of `num`**.
