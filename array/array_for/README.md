This Go program checks if a given user is on a banned list and, if not, allows them to post a response. Let's break down the rules and explain the logic:

---

### **1. Banned Users List**

The program begins by defining a list of banned users as a slice of strings:
```go
bannedUsers := []string{"andrew", "carolina", "david"}
```
- **`bannedUsers`** is a slice, which is a dynamically-sized, flexible view into an array.
- The list contains three banned users: `"andrew"`, `"carolina"`, and `"david"`.

---

### **2. User to Check**

A **user** is defined as `"marie"`:
```go
user := "marie"
```
This is the user whose status will be checked against the banned list.

---

### **3. Check if the User is Banned**

The program uses a `for` loop to iterate through the list of banned users and checks if the given user is in the banned list:
```go
isBanned := false
for _, bannedUser := range bannedUsers {
    if strings.EqualFold(user, bannedUser) {
        isBanned = true
        break
    }
}
```

- **`for _, bannedUser := range bannedUsers`**:
  - This iterates over each element (`bannedUser`) in the `bannedUsers` slice.
  - The underscore (`_`) is used because the index of each element isn't needed.
  
- **`strings.EqualFold(user, bannedUser)`**:
  - This checks if the current `bannedUser` is equal to `user`, ignoring case sensitivity.
  - **`EqualFold`** is a case-insensitive comparison method provided by the `strings` package. So `"marie"` will be considered the same as `"Marie"`, `"MARIE"`, etc.
  
- **`isBanned = true`**:
  - If a match is found (i.e., the user is on the banned list), `isBanned` is set to `true`.
  - **`break`**: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop early once a match is found, preventing unnecessary checks for other banned users.

---

### **4. Output the Result**

Once the loop finishes (either because a match was found or because the loop completed all iterations), the program checks the `isBanned` flag:

```go
if !isBanned {
    fmt.Printf("%s, you can post a response if you wish.\n", strings.Title(user))
}
```

- **`!isBanned`**:
  - If the user is not banned (`isBanned` is `false`), the message will be printed.
  - **`strings.Title(user)`** capitalizes the first letter of the `user` string. So `"marie"` becomes `"Marie"`.
  
The program prints:
```
Marie, you can post a response if you wish.
```

This is the final output if `"marie"` is not on the banned list.

---

### **Key Concepts in This Code:**

1. **Slices**: The `bannedUsers` slice holds the list of banned users. Itâ€™s a dynamic array that allows easy iteration and checking.
2. **Case-insensitive comparison**: The `strings.EqualFold` function ensures that the comparison between `user` and each banned user ignores case.
3. **Looping and early exit**: The `for` loop iterates through the banned users, and if a match is found, it immediately exits using `break`.
4. **Conditional logic**: The program uses a simple `if` statement to print a message only if the user is not banned.
5. **String formatting**: `strings.Title` capitalizes the first letter of the string, ensuring the output is grammatically correct.

---

### **Summary of What Happens:**

- The program defines a list of banned users and checks if the user `"marie"` is in that list.
- If `"marie"` is not banned, the program prints a message saying she can post a response.
- The program uses case-insensitive comparison to ensure it matches users regardless of letter case.
