Let's break down the rules and concepts in this Go code.

### **1. Print a Welcome Message**
```go
fmt.Println("Welcome to a class on arrays")
```
- This is just a print statement displaying a welcome message.

### **2. Declare and Initialize a Fixed-Size Array**
```go
var fruitList [4]string
```
- This declares an array named `fruitList` that can hold **4 elements** of type `string`.
- Initially, Go arrays are **zero-initialized**. In this case, `fruitList` is an array of 4 strings, and all elements will be initialized to the **zero value** for `string`, which is `""` (empty string).

### **3. Assign Values to Array Elements**
```go
fruitList[0] = "Apple"
fruitList[1] = "Tomato"
fruitList[3] = "Peach"
```
- Here, values are assigned to specific indices in the array:
  - `fruitList[0]` is assigned `"Apple"`.
  - `fruitList[1]` is assigned `"Tomato"`.
  - `fruitList[3]` is assigned `"Peach"`.
- Notice that `fruitList[2]` is **not assigned a value**, so it remains the **zero value** for a string, which is `""` (empty string).

### **4. Print the Array**
```go
fmt.Println("Fruit list is: ", fruitList)
```
- This prints the entire array, including the zero-initialized empty element. 
- The output will look like:
  ```
  Fruit list is:  [Apple Tomato  Peach]
  ```
  Notice that the third element (index 2) will be an empty string (`""`), as it was not assigned a value.

### **5. Get the Length of the Array**
```go
fmt.Println("Fruit list length is: ", len(fruitList))
```
- `len(fruitList)` returns the **length of the array**, which is 4, because the array `fruitList` was declared with a size of 4.

### **6. Declare and Initialize Another Array with Values**
```go
var vegList = [3]string{"potato", "beans", "mushroom"}
```
- This declares an array named `vegList` that holds **3 elements** of type `string`, and it is **initialized** with the values `"potato"`, `"beans"`, and `"mushroom"`.
- The array `vegList` is automatically initialized with these values when it is created. The length of `vegList` is 3.

### **7. Print the Second Array**
```go
fmt.Println("Veges list is: ", vegList)
```
- This prints the entire `vegList` array. The output will look like:
  ```
  Veges list is:  [potato beans mushroom]
  ```

### **8. Get the Length of the Second Array**
```go
fmt.Println("Veges list length is: ", len(vegList))
```
- `len(vegList)` returns the **length of the array**, which is 3 because the array `vegList` was declared with a size of 3.

### **Summary of Key Rules & Concepts in the Code:**

1. **Array Declaration**:
   - You can declare arrays with a fixed size by specifying the number of elements, e.g., `[4]string` for an array of 4 strings.
   - Arrays in Go have a fixed size that is part of their type.

2. **Zero Initialization**:
   - Arrays in Go are automatically initialized with zero values for their type. For `string` arrays, the zero value is an empty string (`""`).
   - For example, `fruitList[2]` was never assigned a value, so it remains `""` (empty string).

3. **Array Indexing**:
   - Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index `0`. You access array elements using their index, like `fruitList[0]` to get the first element.

4. **Array Length**:
   - The `len()` function gives the number of elements in an array. For `fruitList`, `len(fruitList)` returns 4, and for `vegList`, `len(vegList)` returns 3.

5. **Array Initialization**:
   - You can initialize an array either by assigning values to individual elements, like `fruitList[0] = "Apple"`, or you can initialize it directly when you declare the array, like `vegList = [3]string{"potato", "beans", "mushroom"}`.

### **Output Example:**
```
Welcome to a class on arrays
Fruit list is:  [Apple Tomato  Peach]
Fruit list length is:  4
Veges list is:  [potato beans mushroom]
Veges list length is:  3
```

In summary, this code shows how to declare arrays of fixed sizes, assign values to elements, and get the length of arrays. It also illustrates how Go arrays automatically initialize to their zero values if not explicitly set.
