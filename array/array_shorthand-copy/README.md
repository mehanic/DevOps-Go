### Explanation of the Code:

The code provided demonstrates how arrays are handled in Go, especially focusing on the concept of **value copying** and **type compatibility**. Let's go step-by-step:

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Declaring an Array and Assigning It:**
   ```go
   blue := [3]int{6, 9, 3}
   ```
   - This line declares an array `blue` of size `3` and type `int`. The elements of the array are initialized to `{6, 9, 3}`.
   - The array `blue` will look like:
     ```
     blue = [6, 9, 3]
     ```

2. **Assigning One Array to Another:**
   ```go
   red := blue
   ```
   - This line declares a new array `red` and assigns it the value of `blue`. **Important:** In Go, arrays are assigned by value. This means that when you assign one array to another, **a copy of the array is made**.
   - At this point, both `blue` and `red` are two separate arrays that contain the same values `{6, 9, 3}`, but they are independent of each other. Changing one array will not affect the other.

3. **Modifying the Original Array (`blue`):**
   ```go
   blue[0] = 10
   ```
   - Here, we modify the first element of the `blue` array to `10`. After this change, `blue` looks like:
     ```
     blue = [10, 9, 3]
     ```
   - Since arrays in Go are **copied by value**, the modification to `blue` does not affect `red`. Thus, `red` still contains the original values `{6, 9, 3}`.

4. **Printing the Arrays:**
   ```go
   fmt.Printf("blue: %#v\n", blue)
   fmt.Printf("red : %#v\n", red)
   ```
   - `fmt.Printf("blue: %#v\n", blue)` prints the `blue` array as `{10, 9, 3}`.
   - `fmt.Printf("red : %#v\n", red)` prints the `red` array as `{6, 9, 3}`.
   - **Output**:
     ```
     blue: [3]int{10, 9, 3}
     red : [3]int{6, 9, 3}
     ```
   - As you can see, the arrays `blue` and `red` are independent after the assignment. Modifying `blue` does not change `red`.

### Explanation of the "UNASSIGNABLE" Part:
```go
// UNASSIGNABLE:
// blue := [3]int{6, 9, 3}
// red := [2]int{3, 5}
// red = blue
```
- This part is commented out, but let's explain it.
- Go **requires arrays to have the same type and length** for assignment to be allowed. You cannot assign an array of one size to an array of a different size. In this case:
  - `blue` is an array of size `3` (`[3]int`).
  - `red` is an array of size `2` (`[2]int`).
  
- Since the sizes are different, trying to assign `blue` to `red` would result in a compilation error because their types (`[3]int` and `[2]int`) do not match.
  
  The error message would look something like:
  ```
  cannot use blue (variable of type [3]int) as type [2]int in assignment
  ```

### Summary:

1. **Arrays in Go are assigned by value**:
   - When you assign one array to another, a **copy** of the array is created, and the two arrays become independent. Changes to one array do not affect the other.
   
2. **Array Type and Length Compatibility**:
   - Arrays must have the **same type and length** to be assigned to each other. Arrays with different sizes or types cannot be assigned to one another.
