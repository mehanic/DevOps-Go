This Go program takes an integer input `n`, reads `n` integers into an array, and then counts how many of those integers are **even** numbers (i.e., divisible by 2). It also prints the array and the count of even numbers. Let's go through the code line by line:

### **Code Breakdown:**

1. **Input Reading (`n`)**:
   ```go
   var n int
   fmt.Scanf("%d", &n)
   ```
   - This line declares a variable `n` of type `int`.
   - `fmt.Scanf` reads the integer value of `n` from the input. This represents the number of elements in the array `arr`.

2. **Array Declaration**:
   ```go
   arr := [100]int{}
   ```
   - This line declares an array `arr` of fixed size 100 to hold integers.  
     - **Note**: The size of 100 is arbitrarily chosen here, and in practice, we could use a slice for more flexibility. But since `n` is inputted, only the first `n` elements of this array will be used.

3. **Input of `n` Elements**:
   ```go
   for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
       var a int
       fmt.Scanf("%d", &a)
       arr[i] = a
   }
   ```
   - A loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`. Inside the loop:
     - `var a int`: Declares an integer `a` to temporarily hold the value being read.
     - `fmt.Scanf("%d", &a)`: Reads an integer and stores it in `a`.
     - `arr[i] = a`: Assigns the value of `a` to the `i`th position in the `arr` array.

4. **Counting Even Numbers**:
   ```go
   counter := 0
   for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
       number := arr[i]
       if number%2 == 0 {
           counter += 1
       }
   }
   ```
   - `counter := 0`: Initializes a counter variable to 0. This will track the number of **even numbers** in the array.
   - A second loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`:
     - `number := arr[i]`: Fetches the `i`th element of the array and stores it in `number`.
     - `if number % 2 == 0`: Checks if the `number` is divisible by 2 (i.e., it’s **even**).
     - `counter += 1`: If the number is even, the counter is incremented by 1.

5. **Output**:
   ```go
   fmt.Println(arr)
   fmt.Println(counter)
   ```
   - `fmt.Println(arr)`: Prints the entire array. Note that this prints the whole array, but since only the first `n` elements are used, the extra elements (if any) will be printed as `0` (since the array was initialized with zeros).
   - `fmt.Println(counter)`: Prints the value of `counter`, which is the total number of **even numbers** in the array.

### **Example Run:**

Let’s go through an example.

#### **Input:**
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

#### **Step-by-Step Execution:**
1. `n = 5`: This means the array will have 5 elements.
2. The program then reads 5 integers: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.
3. The array after input will be: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
4. Now, the program counts the even numbers:
   - `1` is odd, so the counter remains `0`.
   - `2` is even, so the counter becomes `1`.
   - `3` is odd, so the counter remains `1`.
   - `4` is even, so the counter becomes `2`.
   - `5` is odd, so the counter remains `2`.
5. The array is printed: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0, 0, 0, ...]` (Note that elements beyond index 4 are `0`).
6. The number of even numbers is `2`, so the counter is printed: `2`.

#### **Output:**
```
[1 2 3 4 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
2
```

### **Conclusion:**

- The program is designed to take `n` integers, store them in an array, and count how many of those integers are even.
- It uses basic control structures like loops, conditionals, and array operations.
- The `counter` holds the number of even integers found in the array.
