The program defines two functions, `Array()` and `Array2()`, which work with arrays in Go.

1. **`Array()`**:
   - Initializes an array `sayilar` of size 5.
   - Assigns the value `57` to the 4th element (index 3).
   - Prints the array.

2. **`Array2()`**:
   - Initializes an array `sehirler` of size 5 with city names.
   - Prints the entire array.
   - Loops through the array and prints each city individually.

**`main()`** calls both functions sequentially.
