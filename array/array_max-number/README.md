This Go program demonstrates the use of a **2D slice (slice of slices)** and iterates over it to find the maximum value based on certain conditions. Let me break down the code and explain it step by step:

### Code Walkthrough:

```go
arr2 := [][]int{
    {25, 1},
    {70, 1},
    {100, 0},
    {3, 1},
}
```
- **`arr2`** is a **2D slice** (a slice of slices), where each inner slice contains two integers.
- `arr2` represents a collection of data, where the first value in each inner slice is a number, and the second value is either `1` or `0`.
  - Example: `{25, 1}`, `{70, 1}`, `{100, 0}`, and `{3, 1}` are the rows of the 2D slice.
  - The first element is a number (potentially representing some value), and the second element (either `1` or `0`) seems to act as a flag or indicator for whether the number should be considered in the calculation.

### Variables Initialization:
```go
max := arr2[0][0]  // Initializing max with the first element's number
index := 0          // Initializing index to track the position of the maximum value
```
- **`max`** is initialized to the first number of the first inner slice, which is `25` in this case.
- **`index`** is initialized to `0`, which will store the index of the slice where the maximum value is found (starting with `0`).

### Loop Over `arr2`:
```go
for i := 0; i < len(arr2); i++ {
    if arr2[i][0] > max && arr2[i][1] == 1 {
        max = arr2[i][0]
        index = i + 1
    }
}
```
- **`for i := 0; i < len(arr2); i++`**: This loop iterates over all elements of the outer slice `arr2`. The length of `arr2` is 4 (since there are four inner slices).
  
- **`arr2[i][0] > max`**: This condition checks whether the first value in the current slice (i.e., `arr2[i][0]`) is greater than the current `max` value.
  
- **`arr2[i][1] == 1`**: This condition checks whether the second value in the inner slice is `1`. If it is `1`, the number in `arr2[i][0]` will be considered for comparison.

If both conditions are true (i.e., the number is greater than the current `max` and the second value is `1`), then:
- **`max = arr2[i][0]`** updates the `max` to the new value found.
- **`index = i + 1`** updates the `index` to `i + 1`. The reason for adding `1` is likely to give a **1-based index** (i.e., if `i` is `0`, it would become `1`), because slice indices are 0-based in Go, but you might want to track the index from `1`.

### Final Output:
```go
fmt.Println(index)
```
- The `fmt.Println(index)` statement prints the **index** of the inner slice where the maximum value is found (that satisfies the condition of the second value being `1`).

### Breakdown of Logic:

Given the 2D slice:

```go
arr2 := [][]int{
    {25, 1},  // row 1
    {70, 1},  // row 2
    {100, 0}, // row 3
    {3, 1},   // row 4
}
```

Let's go through the loop step by step:

1. **First Iteration (i = 0)**:
   - `arr2[0][0] = 25`, `arr2[0][1] = 1`.
   - `25 > max (25)` is false, so no update occurs.

2. **Second Iteration (i = 1)**:
   - `arr2[1][0] = 70`, `arr2[1][1] = 1`.
   - `70 > max (25)` is true, and `arr2[1][1] == 1` is also true.
   - `max` is updated to `70`, and `index` is updated to `2`.

3. **Third Iteration (i = 2)**:
   - `arr2[2][0] = 100`, `arr2[2][1] = 0`.
   - `arr2[2][1] == 0`, so this row is skipped (we don't check the value of `100`).

4. **Fourth Iteration (i = 3)**:
   - `arr2[3][0] = 3`, `arr2[3][1] = 1`.
   - `3 > max (70)` is false, so no update occurs.

### Conclusion:
- The maximum value found during the iteration is `70`, which is at **index 2** (0-based index).
- Since `index` was initialized to `0` and was updated to `2`, the output will be `2` (this is the **1-based index**, as `i + 1` was used).

### Output:
```
2
```

### Summary of Rules and Behavior:
1. **2D Slice (`[][]`)**: A slice of slices in Go, allowing you to work with tabular data.
2. **Conditions in Loops**: The program uses conditions within the loop to filter data (in this case, checking the second element for `1` and comparing the first element for maximum value).
3. **Indexing**: The program tracks the index of the maximum value based on a condition and updates it with a **1-based index**.
4. **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates over a 2D slice and updates variables if certain conditions are met.
