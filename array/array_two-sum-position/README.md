Let's break down and explain the code step-by-step.

### **Goal:**
The `twoSum` function finds two indices in the given array `nums[]` such that the numbers at those indices add up to the given `target` value. It returns these two indices. If no such pair exists, it returns an empty slice.

### **Code Explanation:**

#### 1. **`twoSum` function:**

```go
func twoSum(nums []int, target int) []int {
	dic := make(map[int]int) // map to store the needed difference for each number
	for index, num := range nums {
		if i, ok := dic[num]; ok { // check if num is in map
			return []int{i, index} // return indices if target pair is found
		}
		dic[target-num] = index // store the difference and current index
	}
	return []int{} // return empty if no solution found
}
```

- **Input:**
  - `nums[]`: A slice (array) of integers.
  - `target`: The target sum we are trying to achieve using two numbers from `nums[]`.

- **Map (`dic`):**
  - `dic` is a map (dictionary) where the key is the difference (`target - num`) that we need to find, and the value is the index of the number that we are considering at the time. Essentially, it's storing what number needs to be added to the current number to reach the target sum.
  
- **Loop through the array:**
  - We iterate through each number in the `nums[]` slice using `for index, num := range nums`. Here, `index` is the index of the current number, and `num` is the current number itself.
  
- **Check if a pair is found:**
  - Inside the loop, we check if the current number `num` exists in the `dic` map using `if i, ok := dic[num]; ok`. 
    - If it exists (`ok == true`), it means the current number `num` and the previously seen number (`dic[num]`) add up to the target. So, we return the indices `[i, index]` where `i` is the index of the previously seen number (from the map), and `index` is the current index.
  
- **Store the difference in the map:**
  - If the pair isn't found, we calculate the difference (`target - num`) and store it in the map as the key, with the value being the current index. This means, we are looking for a number that, when added to `num`, will give us the `target` sum.
  
- **Return empty slice:**
  - If no such pair is found by the end of the loop, we return an empty slice `[]int{}`.

#### 2. **Main Function:**

```go
func main() {
	// Example input
	nums := []int{2, 7, 11, 15}
	target := 9

	// Call twoSum and print result
	result := twoSum(nums, target)
	if len(result) > 0 {
		fmt.Printf("Indices: %d and %d\n", result[0], result[1])
	} else {
		fmt.Println("No two numbers add up to the target.")
	}
}
```

- **Input:**
  - `nums = []int{2, 7, 11, 15}`: A list of integers.
  - `target = 9`: We are trying to find two numbers in the list that add up to 9.

- **Calling `twoSum`:**
  - We call the `twoSum(nums, target)` function with the provided input values.
  - `result` will hold the return value from `twoSum()`. If two numbers that add up to the target are found, `result` will contain their indices.

- **Check if a solution was found:**
  - We check if `len(result) > 0`. If the length of `result` is greater than zero, it means that the two indices were found, and we print them.
  - If no solution was found (i.e., `result` is an empty slice), we print `"No two numbers add up to the target."`

### **How `twoSum` works on the example `nums = []int{2, 7, 11, 15}` and `target = 9`:**

1. **First iteration (index = 0, num = 2):**
   - `dic` is empty at this point.
   - We calculate `target - num = 9 - 2 = 7`, and store `7` as the key in the map with the current index `0`: `dic = {7: 0}`.

2. **Second iteration (index = 1, num = 7):**
   - We check if `num = 7` exists in the map (`dic`).
   - It does exist because `dic[7]` is `0`. This means we found a pair that adds up to the target (2 + 7 = 9).
   - So, we return the indices: `[0, 1]`.

3. **Result:**
   - The function returns `[0, 1]`, meaning that the numbers at indices `0` and `1` (i.e., `2` and `7`) add up to `9`.

### **Output:**
```
Indices: 0 and 1
```

If the target was something that no two numbers could add up to (e.g., `target = 20`), the output would have been:
```
No two numbers add up to the target.
```

### **Time Complexity:**
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the input array `nums[]`.
  - We loop through the array once, and for each element, we perform constant-time operations (checking the map and adding to the map).
- This is efficient because we avoid nested loops and only perform a single pass over the array.

### **Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity is **O(n)** because we use a map to store the differences (`target - num`) and their corresponding indices. The map's size will grow at most to the size of the input array `nums[]`.
