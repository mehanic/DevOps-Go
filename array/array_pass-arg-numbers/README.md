This Go program takes up to 5 numbers as command-line arguments, calculates their sum, and computes the average. Let's break down the rules and logic of the program:

### 1. **Command-Line Arguments Check**:
```go
args := os.Args[1:]
if l := len(args); l == 0 || l > 5 {
    fmt.Println("Please tell me numbers (maximum 5 numbers).")
    return
}
```
- **`os.Args[1:]`**: This is used to access the command-line arguments passed to the program (excluding the program's name at `os.Args[0]`).
- **`len(args)`**: The `len(args)` function is used to determine the number of arguments passed by the user.
- **Argument Length Check**: 
  - If the user doesn't provide any arguments (`l == 0`) or provides more than 5 arguments (`l > 5`), the program prints an error message: `"Please tell me numbers (maximum 5 numbers)."`
  - If the input is valid (i.e., 1 to 5 arguments), the program proceeds to the next steps.

### 2. **Declaring Variables**:
```go
var (
    sum   float64
    nums  [5]float64
    total float64
)
```
- **`sum`**: A `float64` variable used to keep track of the sum of the numbers entered by the user.
- **`nums`**: An array of size 5 (`[5]float64`) to store the numbers provided by the user.
- **`total`**: A `float64` variable that will count how many valid numbers are entered (used to calculate the average).

### 3. **Processing Command-Line Arguments**:
```go
for i, v := range args {
    n, err := strconv.ParseFloat(v, 64)
    if err != nil {
        continue
    }

    total++
    nums[i] = n
    sum += n
}
```
- **`for i, v := range args`**: This loop iterates over each command-line argument (`args`), where `i` is the index and `v` is the value (the string representation of the number).
- **`strconv.ParseFloat(v, 64)`**: This function attempts to convert the string `v` into a `float64`. 
  - If the conversion is successful, `n` contains the floating-point number, and the code proceeds to add it to `sum` and store it in the `nums` array.
  - If the conversion fails (i.e., `err != nil`), the `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration and move to the next argument.
- **`total++`**: This increments the `total` counter, which tracks the number of valid numbers entered by the user.
- **`nums[i] = n`**: This stores the valid number `n` at index `i` in the `nums` array.
- **`sum += n`**: This adds the number `n` to the `sum` variable, which keeps the running total of the valid numbers.

### 4. **Displaying Results**:
```go
fmt.Println("Your numbers:", nums)
fmt.Println("Average:", sum/total)
```
- **`fmt.Println("Your numbers:", nums)`**: This prints the valid numbers entered by the user in the array `nums`.
  - Note: If fewer than 5 numbers are entered, the unused spots in the `nums` array will contain the default value of `0.0` for `float64`.
- **`fmt.Println("Average:", sum/total)`**: This calculates and prints the average of the valid numbers by dividing the `sum` by the `total` (the number of valid numbers).

### 5. **Handling Edge Cases**:
- If the user provides no arguments or more than 5 arguments, the program will print the error message and exit early.
- If the user enters invalid numbers (e.g., non-numeric values), those values will be ignored.
- If there are fewer than 5 valid numbers, the program will still calculate the average correctly for the valid numbers entered, and the unused spots in `nums` will be `0.0`.

### **Example Run**:

If the user runs the program like this:
```bash
go run main.go 56 90 8 34 12
```
The output will be:
```
Your numbers: [56 90 8 34 12]
Average: 40
```

If the user runs the program with an invalid number, like:
```bash
go run main.go 56 90 hello 34 12
```
The output will be:
```
Your numbers: [56 90 0 34 12]
Average: 38.0
```
- In this case, the word `"hello"` will be ignored, and the average will be calculated based only on the valid numbers `56, 90, 34, 12`.

### **Summary of Key Concepts**:
- **Command-Line Arguments**: The program uses `os.Args` to read input provided by the user when running the program.
- **`strconv.ParseFloat`**: This function is used to convert string arguments to `float64`. It handles parsing errors by skipping invalid inputs.
- **Sum and Average Calculation**: The program maintains a running total (`sum`) and a count of valid numbers (`total`), then calculates the average.
- **Array Usage**: The `nums` array stores the valid numbers entered by the user.

This program demonstrates how to work with arrays, command-line arguments, and basic error handling in Go.
