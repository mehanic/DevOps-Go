This Go program works with a multi-dimensional array and performs a formatted print operation to display the data in a structured way. Let's break it down step by step:

### **1. Defining the Multi-Dimensional Array:**
```go
names := [...][3]string{
	{"First Name", "Last Name", "Nickname"},
	{"Albert", "Einstein", "emc2"},
	{"Isaac", "Newton", "apple"},
	{"Stephen", "Hawking", "blackhole"},
	{"Marie", "Curie", "radium"},
	{"Charles", "Darwin", "fittest"},
}
```
- **Multi-dimensional array**: This is an array of arrays. 
  - The first dimension is not fixed (we use `...` to automatically determine the size of the array based on the number of elements).
  - The second dimension has a size of `3`, as each sub-array holds three strings (first name, last name, and nickname).
  
- **What happens here**:
  - `names` is a 2D array where each row contains three string elements, representing a person's first name, last name, and nickname.
  - The `...` tells Go to infer the number of rows automatically, which is `6` in this case because there are 6 entries.

### **2. Iterating Over the `names` Array:**
```go
for i := range names {
	n := names[i]
	fmt.Printf("%-15s %-15s %-15s\n", n[0], n[1], n[2])

	if i == 0 {
		fmt.Println(strings.Repeat("=", 50))
	}
}
```
- **`for i := range names`**: 
  - This loop iterates over the `names` array. The `range` keyword in Go is used to iterate over an array, slice, map, or string. In this case, it iterates over the rows of the `names` array.
  - `i` will be the index of each row (starting from 0).

- **Inside the loop**:
  - `n := names[i]`:
    - This line extracts the current row (`names[i]`) from the `names` array and assigns it to the variable `n`. So, `n` is an array of 3 strings (first name, last name, nickname).
  
  - **Formatted Printing with `fmt.Printf`**:
    ```go
    fmt.Printf("%-15s %-15s %-15s\n", n[0], n[1], n[2])
    ```
    - This `fmt.Printf` statement prints the three strings (first name, last name, and nickname) from the current row of the array.
    - **`%-15s`**:
      - The `%-15s` format specifier means that the string will be left-aligned and take up at least 15 characters. If the string is shorter than 15 characters, it will be padded with spaces on the right. If the string is longer than 15 characters, it will display as is.
    
    - The three format specifiers will ensure that each column (first name, last name, nickname) is printed with a width of 15 characters.

- **Adding a Separator Line for the First Row:**
    ```go
    if i == 0 {
		fmt.Println(strings.Repeat("=", 50))
	}
    ```
    - **`if i == 0`**: This condition ensures that the separator line is printed only after the first row (the header row).
    - **`strings.Repeat("=", 50)`**:
      - This will print a line of 50 `=` characters. This acts as a visual separator between the header row and the rest of the data.

### **3. Output Explanation:**

The output is formatted as a table with 3 columns: First Name, Last Name, and Nickname. The first row contains the column names, and a line of equal signs (`=`) is printed after it as a separator. The rest of the rows display the actual data for each person.

Output:

```
First Name     Last Name      Nickname       
==================================================
Albert         Einstein       emc2           
Isaac          Newton         apple          
Stephen        Hawking        blackhole      
Marie          Curie          radium         
Charles        Darwin         fittest        
```

- **First Row**: Displays the column names ("First Name", "Last Name", "Nickname").
- **Separator Line**: A line of equal signs (`==================================================`), printed only after the first row.
- **Subsequent Rows**: Displays the actual data for each person (first name, last name, and nickname) in a neatly formatted table with 15 characters per column.

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Multi-dimensional Arrays**: This program works with a 2D array (an array of arrays) to store the data for different people. Each sub-array represents one person's details.
2. **`range` in Loops**: The `range` keyword allows you to easily iterate over an array or slice, returning both the index and value. In this case, it gives the index `i` (for each row) and the row data `n`.
3. **Formatted Printing**: The `fmt.Printf` function is used to print data in a structured and readable format. The `%-15s` format specifier ensures that each string is printed in a column with a width of 15 characters, and it is left-aligned.
4. **String Manipulation with `strings.Repeat`**: The `strings.Repeat` function repeats a string a specified number of times. Here, it's used to print a separator line of equal signs (`=`) after the header row.

### **Summary:**

- This program prints a formatted table containing names and nicknames.
- It uses a multi-dimensional array to store the data, and the loop iterates over the array to print each row with appropriate formatting.
- After the header row, a separator line is printed for visual clarity.
