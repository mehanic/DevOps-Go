## **Algorithm Explanation**

This Go program calculates the sum of all elements in an array of integers:

1. **Array Initialization:**
   ```go
   numbers := [...]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
   ```
   - The array `numbers` is initialized with 5 integers: `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5`.

2. **Summing Elements:**
   ```go
   sumi = sumi + numbers[0]
   sumi = sumi + numbers[1]
   sumi = sumi + numbers[2]
   sumi = sumi + numbers[3]
   sumi = sumi + numbers[4]
   ```
   - The program adds each element in the array one by one to the `sumi` variable.

3. **Printing the Result:**
   ```go
   fmt.Println(sumi)
   ```
   - The final sum is printed, which is `15`.

### **Example Output**
```
15
```

### **Key Points**
- The array elements are manually accessed by their index to calculate the sum.
- This approach is straightforward but not scalable for larger arrays, as it requires manual addition for each element.
