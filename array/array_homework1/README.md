This Go program implements a simple calculator that continues to accept user input for arithmetic operations (addition and multiplication). It repeats the process until the user enters `"0"`, which exits the loop. Here's an explanation of the code and the rules it demonstrates:

### **Code Breakdown:**

```go
for {
    var operation string
    fmt.Scanf("%s", &operation)
    if operation == "0" {
        break
    } else if operation == "+" || operation == "-" || operation == "*" || operation == "/" {
        var a, b int
        fmt.Scanf("%d", &a)
        fmt.Scanf("%d", &b)
        if operation == "+" {
            fmt.Println(a + b)
        }
        if operation == "*" {
            fmt.Println(a * b)
        }
    } else {
        fmt.Println("there is no this operation")
    }
}
```

### **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Infinite Loop:**
   - The `for {}` syntax creates an infinite loop that will continue running until a `break` condition is met.
   - This is the main loop that keeps asking the user for input and performs the requested arithmetic operation.

2. **User Input for Operation:**
   - `fmt.Scanf("%s", &operation)` reads the user's input (operation) and stores it in the variable `operation` as a string.
   - The input can be one of the following:
     - `"+"` for addition
     - `"-"` for subtraction (although subtraction is not implemented)
     - `"*"` for multiplication
     - `"/"` for division (though division is also not implemented in the current code)
     - `"0"` to break the loop and exit the program.

3. **Exit Condition:**
   - If the user enters `"0"`, the program calls `break`, which stops the loop and ends the program.
   - This ensures that the calculator can be exited gracefully when the user chooses to stop it.

4. **Valid Operations Check:**
   - If the operation entered by the user is one of `"+"`, `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`, the program proceeds to ask for two integers (`a` and `b`) to perform the calculation.
   - If the operation entered by the user is invalid (not one of the above), it prints: `"there is no this operation"`.

5. **Performing Arithmetic Operations:**
   - The program checks the `operation` string to determine which arithmetic operation to perform:
     - If `operation == "+"`, it adds the two numbers `a` and `b` and prints the result.
     - If `operation == "*"`, it multiplies `a` and `b` and prints the result.
   - **Note**: The program **does not** handle subtraction or division because there are no corresponding `if` conditions for these operations in the code.

6. **Invalid Operation Handling:**
   - If the user enters an operation that isn't one of the predefined operations (`"+", "-", "*", "/"`), the program prints: `"there is no this operation"`.

### **Rules Demonstrated:**

1. **Infinite Loop with Condition for Exit:**
   - The program uses `for {}` to create an infinite loop, which only stops when the `break` statement is executed.
   - This loop keeps asking for the userâ€™s input and processes it.

2. **Reading Input:**
   - `fmt.Scanf("%s", &operation)` reads a string from the user, while `fmt.Scanf("%d", &a)` and `fmt.Scanf("%d", &b)` read integers.
   - The `%s` format specifier reads a string (operation), and `%d` reads an integer (for the two operands).

3. **Conditionals to Handle Operations:**
   - The program uses `if-else` statements to check the operation entered by the user.
   - If the operation is `"+"` or `"*"`, it performs the corresponding arithmetic operation and prints the result.
   - For unsupported operations, the program prints an error message: `"there is no this operation"`.

4. **Break Statement to Exit Loop:**
   - The `break` statement is used to exit the infinite loop when the user inputs `"0"`, which terminates the program gracefully.

5. **No Support for All Operations:**
   - The program currently supports only addition (`+`) and multiplication (`*`).
   - Subtraction (`-`) and division (`/`) are mentioned but not implemented. If the user inputs these operations, no action will be performed.

### **Example Walkthrough:**

#### 1. **Valid Input:**
   - Input: `"+"`
   - The program will then prompt for two integers, say `2` and `3`.
   - Output: `5` (because `2 + 3 = 5`).

#### 2. **Valid Input for Multiplication:**
   - Input: `"*"`
   - The program will prompt for two integers, say `3` and `4`.
   - Output: `12` (because `3 * 4 = 12`).

#### 3. **Invalid Operation:**
   - Input: `"&"`
   - Output: `"there is no this operation"`, since `&` is not a valid operation.

#### 4. **Exit Condition:**
   - Input: `"0"`
   - The program will break out of the loop and terminate.

### **Improvements/Notes:**
- To extend the program, you could add subtraction (`-`) and division (`/`) logic inside the conditionals.
- Error handling could also be added for non-integer inputs, such as if the user enters something that isn't a number when prompted for operands.
