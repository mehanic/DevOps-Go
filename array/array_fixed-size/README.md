### **Explanation of Fixed-Size Arrays in Go**
This Go program demonstrates how to create and use a **fixed-size array** for storing book titles.

### **Key Concepts in the Code**
1. **Fixed-Size Arrays**  
   ```go
   books := [...]string{
       "Kafka's Revenge",
       "Stay Golden",
       "Everythingship",
       "Kafka's Revenge 2nd Edition",
   }
   ```
   - `[...]string` **tells Go to determine the size automatically** based on the number of elements (in this case, `4`).
   - The array is of **fixed size** (`[4]string`), meaning it **cannot grow or shrink** dynamically.

---

### **Printing the Array**
```go
fmt.Printf("books  : %#v\n", books)
```
- The `%#v` **format specifier** prints the array in a **Go syntax-like format**.
- **Output:**
  ```
  books  : [4]string{"Kafka's Revenge", "Stay Golden", "Everythingship", "Kafka's Revenge 2nd Edition"}
  ```

### **Fixed-Size Array Rules in Go**
| **Rule** | **Explanation** |
|----------|----------------|
| **Arrays have fixed sizes** | Once declared, an array's size **cannot** be changed. |
| **Use `[...]` for inferred size** | The compiler automatically determines the array length based on the number of elements. |
| **Cannot append to an array** | Unlike slices, arrays do **not** support the `append()` function. |
| **Zero values for missing elements** | If an array is initialized with fewer elements than its size, the missing elements take **default zero values** (empty strings in this case). |
| **Stored in contiguous memory** | Arrays provide **fast access** but are less flexible than slices. |
