This Go program demonstrates **array declaration, initialization, and default values**. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### **Code Breakdown**
```go
names := [...]string{"Einstein", "Shepard", "Tesla"}
```
- The `[...]` **ellipsis operator** allows Go to **automatically determine** the array size based on the number of elements.
- Since there are **three** elements (`"Einstein"`, `"Shepard"`, `"Tesla"`), Go infers the type as `[3]string`.
- The final array:
  ```go
  [3]string{"Einstein", "Shepard", "Tesla"}
  ```

---

```go
books := [5]string{"Kafka's Revenge", "Stay Golden"}
```
- Here, the array size **is explicitly set to 5** (`[5]string`).
- Only **two elements** are initialized: `"Kafka's Revenge"` and `"Stay Golden"`.
- The **remaining three** elements default to Go's **zero value for strings**, which is an **empty string (`""`)**.
- The final array:
  ```go
  [5]string{"Kafka's Revenge", "Stay Golden", "", "", ""}
  ```

---

### **Printing the Arrays**
```go
fmt.Printf("%q\n", names)
```
- `%q` prints the array elements as **quoted strings**.
- **Output:**
  ```
  ["Einstein" "Shepard" "Tesla"]
  ```

```go
fmt.Printf("%q\n", books)
```
- Since `books` has three uninitialized elements, they are printed as empty strings (`""`).
- **Output:**
  ```
  ["Kafka's Revenge" "Stay Golden" "" "" ""]
  ```

### **Key Rules & Takeaways**
| Concept | Explanation |
|---------|------------|
| **Ellipsis (`[...]`)** | Lets Go automatically determine the array size based on the number of elements. |
| **Explicit Array Size (`[N]`)** | Forces a fixed size; uninitialized elements default to their **zero value**. |
| **String Zero Value** | Uninitialized string elements in an array default to `""` (empty string). |
| **Printing with `%q`** | Displays array elements as quoted strings, making it clear where empty values exist. |

### **Would You Like More?**
Would you like an **example with slices** instead of arrays? Slices in Go are more flexible and avoid the issue of zero values for extra elements. ðŸš€
