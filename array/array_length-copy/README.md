This Go program demonstrates how arrays are used in Go, including their initialization, manipulation, and copying. Let's go through the code and explain the rules and behavior step-by-step.

### **1. Declaring and Initializing Arrays:**

```go
var first [2]bool
second := [...]int{-1, -2, -3}
third := [16]uint{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
var fourth [2][2]float32
fifth := [2][2]float32{{1}, {5.4, 7.7}}
```

- **`first [2]bool`**: This declares an array of size 2, with elements of type `bool`. By default, elements of a boolean array are initialized to `false`.
  
- **`second := [...]int{-1, -2, -3}`**: This uses the **ellipsis (`...`)** operator to declare and initialize an array of type `int`. The length of the array is inferred automatically based on the number of elements provided (`3` in this case).

- **`third := [16]uint{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`**: This declares an array `third` of size 16 with `uint` type elements. Only the first six values are initialized (the rest are automatically set to the default value of `0` for unsigned integers).

- **`fourth [2][2]float32`**: This is a two-dimensional array (array of arrays) with a size of 2x2. By default, all elements are initialized to `0.0`.

- **`fifth := [2][2]float32{{1}, {5.4, 7.7}}`**: This is another two-dimensional array, initialized with specific values. The first inner array has one element initialized to `1.0`, and the second inner array has two elements `5.4` and `7.7`. The remaining values in both arrays are initialized to `0.0`.

### **2. Printing Array Length and Values:**
```go
fmt.Printf("first len(%d) = %v\n", len(first), first)
fmt.Printf("second len(%d) = %v\n", len(second), second)
fmt.Printf("third len(%d) = %v\n", len(third), third)
fmt.Printf("fourth len(%d) = %v\n", len(fourth), fourth)
fmt.Printf("fifth len(%d) = %v\n", len(fifth), fifth)
```

- **`len(first)`**: The `len()` function returns the length of the array. For `first`, the length is 2.
- **`first`**: This prints the contents of the array. For the `first` array, it will print `[false false]` because both elements are initialized to `false`.

This process is repeated for each of the arrays (`second`, `third`, `fourth`, `fifth`) using `len()` to print their respective lengths and values.

### **3. Accessing Array Elements:**
```go
fmt.Println("second[2] :", second[2])
fmt.Println("fifth[0][1] :", fifth[0][1])
```

- **`second[2]`**: This accesses the element at index 2 in the `second` array, which is `-3` (the last element in the array).
  
- **`fifth[0][1]`**: This accesses the element at index `1` of the first inner array (`fifth[0]`). Since the first inner array is `{1, 0}`, this will print `0`.

### **4. Modifying an Array and Copying:**
```go
copyOfThird := third
third[4] = 500
third[5] = 600
third[6] = 700
third[7] = 800
third[8] = 900

fmt.Println("third :", third)
fmt.Println("copyOfThird :", copyOfThird)
```

- **`copyOfThird := third`**: In Go, arrays are **passed by value**. This means that when `third` is assigned to `copyOfThird`, a **new copy** of the `third` array is created. Changes to `third` will not affect `copyOfThird`.

- **Modifying `third`**: After assigning to `copyOfThird`, the values in `third` at indices `4, 5, 6, 7, 8` are changed to `500, 600, 700, 800, 900` respectively. This modifies the `third` array but does not affect `copyOfThird`.

- **Print Statements**:
  - **`third`**: After modification, `third` will contain the new values and default zeros at indices `9` to `15`.
  - **`copyOfThird`**: Since arrays are passed by value, `copyOfThird` remains unchanged and holds the original values.

### **5. Length of an Array:**
```go
b := [...]int{1, 3, 5}
fmt.Println(len(b))
```

- **`len(b)`**: This prints the length of the array `b`. Since `b` contains three elements (`1, 3, 5`), the length will be `3`.

### **Program Output:**
```
first len(2) = [false false]
second len(3) = [-1 -2 -3]
third len(16) = [1 2 3 4 5 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
fourth len(2) = [[0 0] [0 0]]
fifth len(2) = [[1 0] [5.4 7.7]]
second[2] : -3
fifth[0][1] : 0
third : [1 2 3 4 500 600 700 800 900 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
copyOfThird : [1 2 3 4 5 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
3
```

### **Summary of Key Rules:**

1. **Array Initialization**:
   - Arrays can be initialized with specific values or the size can be inferred using the `...` ellipsis.
   - Arrays are **fixed in size** once defined and cannot be resized.

2. **Array Length**:
   - The length of an array can be obtained using the `len()` function.
   - This gives the number of elements in the array, even if some elements are left uninitialized (default values are used in that case).

3. **Multidimensional Arrays**:
   - Go supports multidimensional arrays (arrays of arrays). These are declared like `[2][2]float32`.
   - You can initialize multidimensional arrays with specific values.

4. **Passing Arrays by Value**:
   - In Go, arrays are passed **by value**. When an array is assigned to another variable, a copy is made, and changes to one array do not affect the other.

5. **Array Indexing**:
   - You can access individual elements of an array using the index (`array[index]`).
   - Arrays are **zero-indexed**, meaning the first element is at index `0`.

6. **Array Default Values**:
   - Uninitialized elements of an array get the **zero value** of the respective type (e.g., `0` for `int`, `false` for `bool`, `0.0` for `float32`).

By understanding these rules, you can work effectively with arrays in Go, especially when dealing with multidimensional arrays, modifying array elements, and passing arrays between functions.
