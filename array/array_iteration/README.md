This Go program demonstrates two different ways to iterate over an array of integers: using a **traditional for loop** and a **range loop**. Let's break down each part of the code and explain the rules demonstrated.

### **1. Declaring the Array:**
```go
numbers := [5]int{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
```
- **Array Definition:**  
  - An array named `numbers` is defined with 5 elements of type `int`. The array is initialized with the values `{10, 20, 30, 40, 50}`. 
  - `numbers` has a fixed size of 5 because it’s defined with `[5]int`.

### **2. Using a Traditional For Loop:**
```go
fmt.Println("Iterating using traditional for loop:")
for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++ {
    fmt.Printf("Index: %d, Value: %d\n", i, numbers[i])
}
```
- **Traditional For Loop:**
  - The traditional for loop is defined with `for i := 0; i < len(numbers); i++`, where:
    - `i` is the loop variable that represents the index of the array.
    - `len(numbers)` returns the length of the array, so the loop runs from index `0` to `4` (for a 5-element array).
  - Inside the loop, `numbers[i]` accesses the value at the `i`-th index of the `numbers` array.
  - The `fmt.Printf` function prints the **index** and the **value** at that index.

- **Key Points:**
  - **Manual Indexing:** You manually manage the index (`i`), and you must access the value by indexing the array (`numbers[i]`).
  - **Control over Loop:** You have more explicit control over the loop parameters (initial index, condition, and increment).

### **3. Using a Range Loop:**
```go
fmt.Println("\nIterating using range loop:")
for index, value := range numbers {
    fmt.Printf("Index: %d, Value: %d\n", index, value)
}
```
- **Range Loop:**
  - The `range` keyword simplifies the process of iterating over a collection (like arrays or slices).
  - `for index, value := range numbers` does the following:
    - `index` is the index of the current element in the array.
    - `value` is the value of the element at that index.
  - The `range` loop automatically takes care of iterating over the array and extracting both the **index** and **value** without needing manual indexing.
  
- **Key Points:**
  - **Automatic Indexing:** The range loop provides a more concise and readable way to iterate over arrays and slices.
  - **Extracts Both Index and Value:** You get both the **index** and **value** in the loop, making it easier to work with the array without needing to manually access elements.

### **Program Output:**
```
Iterating using traditional for loop:
Index: 0, Value: 10
Index: 1, Value: 20
Index: 2, Value: 30
Index: 3, Value: 40
Index: 4, Value: 50

Iterating using range loop:
Index: 0, Value: 10
Index: 1, Value: 20
Index: 2, Value: 30
Index: 3, Value: 40
Index: 4, Value: 50
```

### **Summary of Rules Demonstrated:**

1. **Traditional For Loop:**  
   - In Go, a **traditional for loop** uses manual index management. You define the starting index, loop condition, and increment.
   - The loop is more flexible but requires you to manually access array elements by indexing.
   
2. **Range Loop:**  
   - The **range loop** automatically provides both the **index** and **value** of the elements being iterated over.
   - It’s more concise and readable, especially when you need both the index and value during iteration.

3. **Array Indexing:**  
   - In both loops, you access array elements using the index, but the range loop abstracts this process.

In general, the range loop is recommended for most cases when iterating over an array or slice, as it's easier to read and eliminates the need to manually handle the index and access each element. The traditional for loop is more flexible and useful in cases where you need more fine-grained control over the loop behavior.
