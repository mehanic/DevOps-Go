This Go code contains two functions that demonstrate how to create and work with **1D arrays** and **2D arrays** (multidimensional arrays). Here's an explanation of the rules, concepts, and flow of the code:

---

### **1. `CreateArray` Function (Working with a 1D Array)**

```go
package arrays

import "fmt"

func CreateArray() {
    var numbers [5]int // An integer array contains 5 numbers
    // or numbers:= [5]int{10,20,30,40,50}

    numbers[0] = 10
    numbers[1] = 20
    numbers[2] = 30
    numbers[3] = 40
    numbers[4] = 50

    fmt.Println(numbers)

    // Now write each number while looping
    for ind := 0; ind < len(numbers); ind++ {
        fmt.Printf("Index %v is %v\n", ind, numbers[ind])
    }
}
```

#### **Key Concepts in `CreateArray`:**

1. **Array Declaration**:
   - `var numbers [5]int` declares an **array of integers** with 5 elements. In Go, arrays are fixed in size, and the size is part of the type.
   - The array `numbers` will hold 5 integer values, with each element initialized to the **zero value** for the type (`0` for integers) unless explicitly initialized.

2. **Array Initialization**:
   - You can directly assign values to individual elements of the array:
     ```go
     numbers[0] = 10
     numbers[1] = 20
     numbers[2] = 30
     numbers[3] = 40
     numbers[4] = 50
     ```
   - Here, each index of the array is assigned a specific value.

3. **Printing the Entire Array**:
   - `fmt.Println(numbers)` prints the entire array in its current state. The output will look like this:
     ```
     [10 20 30 40 50]
     ```

4. **Iterating Over the Array**:
   - A `for` loop is used to iterate over each index of the array and print the index and corresponding value.
     ```go
     for ind := 0; ind < len(numbers); ind++ {
         fmt.Printf("Index %v is %v\n", ind, numbers[ind])
     }
     ```
   - `len(numbers)` returns the length of the array, which is `5`, so the loop runs 5 times (from `ind = 0` to `ind = 4`).
   - The loop prints the index and the value at that index.

   **Output**:
   ```
   Index 0 is 10
   Index 1 is 20
   Index 2 is 30
   Index 3 is 40
   Index 4 is 50
   ```

### **2. `CreateMultidimensionalArray` Function (Working with a 2D Array)**

```go
package arrays

import "fmt"

func CreateMultidimensionalArray() {
    var countries_and_cities [3][2]string

    countries_and_cities[0][0] = "Istanbul"
    countries_and_cities[0][1] = "Ankara"
    countries_and_cities[1][0] = "Berlin"
    countries_and_cities[1][1] = "Hamburg"
    countries_and_cities[2][0] = "Vienna"
    countries_and_cities[2][1] = "Graz"

    fmt.Println("Countries and Cities ", countries_and_cities)

    for ind := 0; ind < 3; ind++ {
        for sind := 0; sind < 2; sind++ {
            fmt.Println(countries_and_cities[ind][sind])
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Key Concepts in `CreateMultidimensionalArray`:**

1. **2D Array Declaration**:
   - `var countries_and_cities [3][2]string` declares a **2D array** with 3 rows and 2 columns, where each element is a string.
     - The outer array has 3 rows (representing countries).
     - Each row contains 2 elements (representing cities).
   - `countries_and_cities` is the name of the 2D array.

2. **Array Initialization**:
   - Each element of the 2D array is initialized by specifying its row and column:
     ```go
     countries_and_cities[0][0] = "Istanbul"
     countries_and_cities[0][1] = "Ankara"
     countries_and_cities[1][0] = "Berlin"
     countries_and_cities[1][1] = "Hamburg"
     countries_and_cities[2][0] = "Vienna"
     countries_and_cities[2][1] = "Graz"
     ```
   - This sets specific cities in the respective rows and columns.

3. **Printing the Entire 2D Array**:
   - `fmt.Println("Countries and Cities ", countries_and_cities)` prints the entire 2D array. The output will be:
     ```
     Countries and Cities  [[Istanbul Ankara] [Berlin Hamburg] [Vienna Graz]]
     ```

4. **Nested Loops to Access 2D Array Elements**:
   - To loop through a **2D array**, you use a nested loop:
     ```go
     for ind := 0; ind < 3; ind++ {
         for sind := 0; sind < 2; sind++ {
             fmt.Println(countries_and_cities[ind][sind])
         }
     }
     ```
   - The outer loop (`for ind := 0; ind < 3; ind++`) iterates over the rows (countries).
   - The inner loop (`for sind := 0; sind < 2; sind++`) iterates over the columns (cities).
   - This nested loop prints the countries and their respective cities.

   **Output**:
   ```
   Istanbul
   Ankara
   Berlin
   Hamburg
   Vienna
   Graz
   ```

### **Summary of the Rules:**

1. **Array Declaration**:
   - You can declare arrays in Go by specifying the size and type, such as `[5]int` for an array of 5 integers or `[3][2]string` for a 2D array of 3 rows and 2 columns of strings.

2. **Array Indexing**:
   - Arrays are indexed starting from `0`. To access an element in a 1D array, you use the syntax `array[index]`.
   - For 2D arrays, use `array[row][column]` to access specific elements.

3. **Iterating Over Arrays**:
   - You can use a **`for` loop** to iterate over an array. For 1D arrays, iterate using the array length, and for 2D arrays, use **nested loops** to iterate over both rows and columns.

4. **Arrays are Fixed in Size**:
   - Once an array is declared with a fixed size (e.g., `[5]int`), it cannot be resized. You must declare the exact size when the array is created.

---

### **Summary of the Output:**

- **1D Array (`numbers`) Output:**
  ```
  [10 20 30 40 50]
  Index 0 is 10
  Index 1 is 20
  Index 2 is 30
  Index 3 is 40
  Index 4 is 50
  ```

- **2D Array (`countries_and_cities`) Output:**
  ```
  Countries and Cities  [[Istanbul Ankara] [Berlin Hamburg] [Vienna Graz]]
  Istanbul
  Ankara
  Berlin
  Hamburg
  Vienna
  Graz
  ```

This program demonstrates how to work with both 1D and 2D arrays in Go, showing how to declare, initialize, and access elements using loops.
