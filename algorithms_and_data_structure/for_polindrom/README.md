Let's go through both pieces of code you've shared and explain them step by step:

### First Program: Palindrome Check

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	var (
		number   = 123454321
		summer   = 0
		num_clone = number
	)

	for number > 0 {
		summer = summer * 10 + (number % 10)
		number /= 10
	}

	if summer == num_clone {
		fmt.Println("Palindrome")
		return
	} 

	fmt.Println("Not Palindrome")
}
```

### Explanation:

This program checks if a given number is a **palindrome**. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. Here's how the program works:

1. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `number = 123454321`: This is the original number that we are going to check if it's a palindrome.
   - `summer = 0`: This will store the reversed number.
   - `num_clone = number`: This stores the original number so we can compare it with the reversed number at the end.

2. **Reversing the Number**:
   - The `for number > 0` loop will reverse the digits of `number`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `summer = summer * 10 + (number % 10)`: This extracts the last digit of `number` (using `number % 10`) and adds it to the reversed number `summer`. The `summer * 10` shifts the digits left by one place.
     - `number /= 10`: This removes the last digit from `number` by performing integer division by 10.

3. **Palindrome Check**:
   - After the loop finishes, `summer` holds the reversed number.
   - `if summer == num_clone`: If the reversed number (`summer`) is equal to the original number (`num_clone`), then it's a palindrome.
     - If it's a palindrome, it prints `"Palindrome"`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `"Not Palindrome"`.

### Example Output:
```
Palindrome
```

If the number were `123456`, the output would be `"Not Palindrome"`.

### Second Program: Prime Numbers

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main1() {

	var (
		prime_count = 100
		number      = 2
	)

	for prime_count > 0 {
		var is_prime bool = true
		for i := 2; i < number; i++ {

			if number % i == 0 {
				is_prime = false
				break
			}
		}

		if is_prime {
			fmt.Printf("%d ", number)
			prime_count--
		}
		number++
	}

	fmt.Println()
}
```

### Explanation:

This program generates and prints the first 100 **prime numbers**.

1. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `prime_count = 100`: This represents how many prime numbers we want to find and print.
   - `number = 2`: This is the number that will be checked to see if it's prime.

2. **Prime Number Search**:
   - `for prime_count > 0`: This loop continues until 100 prime numbers are found.
   - Inside this loop:
     - `var is_prime bool = true`: This assumes the current `number` is prime initially.
     - `for i := 2; i < number; i++`: This loop checks if `number` is divisible by any integer between `2` and `number-1`. If it is divisible, then `number` is **not prime**.
       - `if number % i == 0`: If `number` is divisible by `i`, set `is_prime` to `false`, indicating it's not a prime number, and exit the loop using `break`.
     - After checking all divisors, if `is_prime` is still `true`, it means `number` is prime, and we print the number.
       - `fmt.Printf("%d ", number)`: Prints the prime number.
       - `prime_count--`: Decreases the count of prime numbers remaining to find.
     - `number++`: Moves to the next number to check for primality.

3. **Stopping Condition**:
   - Once 100 primes have been printed, the outer loop (`for prime_count > 0`) will stop, and the program will print a newline with `fmt.Println()`.

### Example Output:
```
2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97 101 103 107 109 113 127 131 137 139 149 151 157 163 167 173 179 181 191 193 197 199 211 223 227 229 233 239 241 251 257 263 269 271 277 281 283 293 307 311 313 317 331 337 347 349 353 359 367 373 379 383 389 397 401 409 419 421 431 433 439 443 449 457 461 463 467 479 487 491 499 503 509 521 523 541 547 557 563 569 571 577 587 593 599 601 607 613 617 619 631 641 643 647 653 659 661 673 677 683 691 701 709 719 727 733 739 743 751 757 761 769 773 787 797 809 811 821 823 827 829 839 853 857 859 863 877 881 883 887 907 911 919 929 937 941 947 953 967 971 977 983 991 997 
```

### How the Program Works:

1. **Prime Check**: It checks if a number is divisible by any number smaller than itself and greater than 1.
2. **Efficiency**: The program uses the brute force method of checking divisibility by all numbers less than the current number to determine primality. It checks divisibility from 2 to `number-1`, and if the number is divisible, it's not a prime.

### Summary:

- **Palindrome Program**: Reverses a number and compares it to the original number to determine if it is a palindrome.
- **Prime Number Program**: Finds and prints the first 100 prime numbers by checking each number for divisibility with all integers smaller than itself.
