Let's break down the provided Go code and explain its rules and logic:

### Code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func tub(n int) {
	for i := 2; i <= n; i++ {
		var count = 0
		for j := 2; j <= i; j++ {
			if i%j == 0 {
				count++
			}
		}
		if count == 1 {
			fmt.Printf("%d ", i)
		}
	}
	fmt.Println()
}

func main() {
	tub(13)
}
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Main Function**:
   ```go
   func main() {
       tub(13)
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function is the entry point for the Go program. In this case, it calls the `tub` function with the argument `13`.
   - This means the program will attempt to find and print all prime numbers from 2 to 13.

2. **The `tub` Function**:
   ```go
   func tub(n int) {
       for i := 2; i <= n; i++ {
           var count = 0
           for j := 2; j <= i; j++ {
               if i % j == 0 {
                   count++
               }
           }
           if count == 1 {
               fmt.Printf("%d ", i)
           }
       }
       fmt.Println()
   }
   ```
   - The function `tub` takes an integer `n` as an argument and finds all prime numbers from 2 up to `n`.
   
3. **Outer Loop (Looping through all numbers from 2 to `n`)**:
   ```go
   for i := 2; i <= n; i++ {
       var count = 0
       // inner loop to check divisibility
   }
   ```
   - This loop starts at `i = 2` and continues up to `i = n`. This means that for every number `i`, the program checks if `i` is a prime number.
   
4. **Inner Loop (Checking Divisibility)**:
   ```go
   for j := 2; j <= i; j++ {
       if i % j == 0 {
           count++
       }
   }
   ```
   - For each `i`, this inner loop checks if `i` can be divided by any number `j` starting from 2 up to `i`.
   - The condition `i % j == 0` checks if `i` is divisible by `j` (i.e., `i` divided by `j` leaves no remainder).
   - If `i % j == 0`, the `count` is incremented by 1. This means `i` has at least one divisor other than 1 (which means `i` is not a prime).

5. **Check If the Number is Prime**:
   ```go
   if count == 1 {
       fmt.Printf("%d ", i)
   }
   ```
   - After the inner loop, the program checks if `count` is equal to 1. This is important:
     - If `count == 1`, it means the number `i` has exactly two divisors (1 and `i` itself), which is the definition of a prime number.
     - If `i` is prime, it gets printed using `fmt.Printf("%d ", i)`.

6. **Print a New Line**:
   ```go
   fmt.Println()
   ```
   - After completing the outer loop, a newline is printed for better formatting, so the output appears on a new line.

### Example Execution for `tub(13)`:

1. The `tub` function is called with `n = 13`.
2. The outer loop will go through numbers from `2` to `13`, checking each one to see if it's prime.

   - For `i = 2`, the inner loop checks divisibility by `2`. Since `2` is only divisible by `1` and `2`, `count` remains `1`, so `2` is printed.
   - For `i = 3`, the inner loop checks divisibility by `2` and `3`. Since `3` is only divisible by `1` and `3`, `count` remains `1`, so `3` is printed.
   - For `i = 4`, the inner loop finds divisibility by `2`, so `count` is incremented to `2`. Since `count` is greater than `1`, `4` is not printed.
   - For `i = 5`, the inner loop finds that `5` is divisible by `1` and `5`, so `count` is `1`, and `5` is printed.
   - The same process continues for the numbers `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `10`, `11`, `12`, and `13`.

   - Prime numbers between `2` and `13` are `2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13`.

3. **Output**:
   ```go
   2 3 5 7 11 13
   ```

### Explanation of Prime Number Logic:

A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. The program checks if a number `i` has exactly two divisors: `1` and `i` itself. If so, it's a prime number.

### Efficiency Consideration:

- **Time Complexity**: The inner loop checks every number `j` from `2` to `i`. This means the time complexity of the program is **O(n^2)** (since for each number `i`, we perform `i` checks). This is not the most efficient way to find prime numbers, as more optimized methods (such as the **Sieve of Eratosthenes**) exist that can find primes in **O(n log log n)** time complexity.

### Summary:

- The function `tub` finds all the prime numbers from `2` to `n`.
- It uses a nested loop to check for divisibility and counts how many divisors the number `i` has.
- If the number has exactly two divisors (`1` and itself), it's printed as a prime number.
