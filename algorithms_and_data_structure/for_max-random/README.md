Let's break down the code you provided, step by step, and explain each part.

### Code Breakdown:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// задает максимальное число которое может быть рандомным
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UTC().UnixNano())
```

1. **Package Declaration**:
   - `package main`: This indicates that this is an executable Go program. The `main` function is the entry point of the program.

2. **Imports**:
   - `import "fmt"`: This imports the `fmt` package, which is used for formatted I/O (input/output) in Go. It's used here to print to the console.
   - `import "math/rand"`: This imports the `rand` package, which is used to generate random numbers.
   - `import "time"`: This imports the `time` package, which is used here to get the current Unix timestamp to seed the random number generator.

3. **Seeding the Random Number Generator**:
   - `rand.Seed(time.Now().UTC().UnixNano())`: This line sets the seed for the random number generator to ensure that the numbers generated are random and not the same every time the program runs.
     - `time.Now().UTC().UnixNano()` generates a timestamp in nanoseconds, which is used to seed the random number generator. This ensures that each execution of the program will produce different random numbers.

### Generating Random Numbers:

```go
	n := 5
	a := []int{}
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		k := rand.Intn(100)
		a = append(a, k)
	}
	fmt.Println(a)
```

4. **Generating Random Numbers**:
   - `n := 5`: This defines the number `n`, which is the number of random numbers you want to generate (in this case, 5 random numbers).
   - `a := []int{}`: This initializes an empty slice `a` of integers where the random numbers will be stored.
   - `for i := 0; i < n; i++ { ... }`: This is a `for` loop that runs `n` times (5 times in this case) to generate and store random numbers.
     - `rand.Intn(100)`: This generates a random integer between `0` and `99` (inclusive). `Intn(100)` means it will generate a number from 0 up to, but not including, 100.
     - `a = append(a, k)`: The random number `k` is added (appended) to the slice `a`.
   - After the loop ends, the slice `a` contains 5 random numbers, and `fmt.Println(a)` prints the slice to the console.

### Calculating the Sum:

```go
	// sumi
	sumi := 0
	for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
		sumi += a[i]
	}
	fmt.Println(sumi)
}
```

5. **Summing the Numbers**:
   - `sumi := 0`: This initializes the variable `sumi` to `0`. This will be used to accumulate the sum of the elements in the slice `a`.
   - `for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ { ... }`: This is another `for` loop that iterates through all the elements in the slice `a`.
     - `sumi += a[i]`: On each iteration, the current element `a[i]` is added to `sumi`.
   - After the loop completes, `sumi` will hold the sum of all the random numbers in the slice `a`. Finally, `fmt.Println(sumi)` prints the sum to the console.

### Example Output:

If the random numbers generated are `[12, 53, 8, 40, 21]`, the output would be:

```
[12 53 8 40 21]
134
```

Explanation:
- The program generated the random numbers: `12`, `53`, `8`, `40`, and `21`.
- The sum of these numbers is: `12 + 53 + 8 + 40 + 21 = 134`.

### Summary:

1. **Seeding the Random Number Generator**: The program uses `time.Now().UnixNano()` to seed the random number generator, ensuring random results each time it runs.
2. **Generating Random Numbers**: The program generates 5 random numbers between 0 and 99 and stores them in a slice `a`.
3. **Summing the Numbers**: It then sums up the numbers in the slice `a` and prints the sum.

This code demonstrates how to generate random numbers, store them in a slice, and then calculate the sum of those numbers.
