Let's break down and explain the Go code step by step.

### Code Overview:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func twoSum(nums []int, target int) []int {
    for i, el := range nums {
        for j := i + 1; j < len(nums); j++ {
            if el + nums[j] == target {
                return []int{i, j}
            }
        }
    }
    return []int{0, 0}
}

func main() {
    fmt.Println(twoSum([]int{3, 2, 3}, 6))
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **`twoSum` function**:
   ```go
   func twoSum(nums []int, target int) []int {
       for i, el := range nums {
           for j := i + 1; j < len(nums); j++ {
               if el + nums[j] == target {
                   return []int{i, j}
               }
           }
       }
       return []int{0, 0}
   }
   ```

   - The `twoSum` function is designed to find two numbers from the `nums` slice whose sum is equal to the `target`.
   
   **Parameters**:
   - `nums []int`: A slice of integers, representing the numbers to check.
   - `target int`: The target sum that we are trying to achieve by adding two distinct numbers from the `nums` slice.

   **Function Logic**:
   - The function uses two nested `for` loops to check every pair of distinct elements from the `nums` slice.
   
   **Outer loop**:
   - `for i, el := range nums`: This iterates over the `nums` slice where `i` is the index and `el` is the value of the current element.
   
   **Inner loop**:
   - `for j := i + 1; j < len(nums); j++`: This loop iterates over the remaining elements in the slice that come after the current element `el`. This ensures that each pair of distinct elements is checked only once.
   
   **Condition**:
   - `if el + nums[j] == target`: If the sum of the current element `el` and the element at index `j` equals the `target`, then we return the indices `[i, j]` as a slice.
   
   **Return value**:
   - If a pair of numbers is found that adds up to the `target`, their indices `[i, j]` are returned immediately.
   - If no such pair is found after checking all combinations, the function returns `[0, 0]`, indicating that no solution was found.

2. **`main` function**:
   ```go
   func main() {
       fmt.Println(twoSum([]int{3, 2, 3}, 6))
   }
   ```
   - The `main` function calls the `twoSum` function with the arguments:
     - `nums = []int{3, 2, 3}` (the list of numbers to search through).
     - `target = 6` (the target sum we are looking for).
   - The result of the `twoSum` function is printed using `fmt.Println`.

### Example Walkthrough:

Letâ€™s walk through the `twoSum` function with the input `nums = []int{3, 2, 3}` and `target = 6`.

- **First Iteration (Outer Loop)**:
  - `i = 0`, `el = 3`
  - **Inner Loop** (with `j = 1`):
    - `nums[0] + nums[1] = 3 + 2 = 5`, which is not equal to `6`. Continue to the next iteration of the inner loop.
  - **Inner Loop** (with `j = 2`):
    - `nums[0] + nums[2] = 3 + 3 = 6`, which **is equal to** the `target`.
    - So, we return the indices `[0, 2]`.

Since we found the solution during the first iteration, the function immediately returns the indices `[0, 2]`, and the program prints that result.

### Final Output:
```
[0 2]
```

### Summary of Logic:
- **Purpose**: The `twoSum` function finds two distinct numbers from the `nums` array that add up to the given `target` and returns their indices.
- **Approach**: The function uses a **brute-force** approach with two nested `for` loops to check each pair of distinct numbers.
  - **Outer loop** iterates through each element.
  - **Inner loop** starts from the next element and checks if the sum of the two elements equals the target.
  - If such a pair is found, the function returns their indices.
- **Return value**: It returns the indices of the two numbers whose sum equals the target, or `[0, 0]` if no such pair is found.

### Performance Note:
- This approach has a **time complexity** of **O(n^2)** due to the two nested loops, where `n` is the length of the `nums` slice.
