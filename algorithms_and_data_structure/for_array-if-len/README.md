This Go program demonstrates how to **sort** an array using a **simple sorting algorithm** that compares elements pairwise and swaps them if necessary. However, the algorithm used here is not the most efficient sorting algorithm (it's akin to **bubble sort**). Letâ€™s break it down step by step.

### **Step-by-step Explanation:**

### 1. **Array Declaration and Initialization**
```go
arr := []int{4, 3, 2, -1, 3, 2}
n := len(arr)
```
- The program starts by defining an array `arr` with the following values:
  ```
  [4, 3, 2, -1, 3, 2]
  ```
- `n := len(arr)` calculates the length of the array, which in this case is `6`.

---

### 2. **The Sorting Loop**
```go
for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
    for j := 0; j < n; j++ {
        if arr[i] < arr[j] {
            arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
        }
    }
}
```
- The sorting logic is implemented in **nested loops**:
  
  - The **outer loop** (`i` loop) runs from `0` to `n-1` (i.e., `i = 0` to `i = 5`).
  - The **inner loop** (`j` loop) also runs from `0` to `n-1` (i.e., `j = 0` to `j = 5`).

#### Inside the Inner Loop:
- The program checks whether the element at `arr[i]` is **less than** the element at `arr[j]`:
  ```go
  if arr[i] < arr[j]
  ```
- If this condition is `true`, it **swaps** the elements at indices `i` and `j`:
  ```go
  arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]
  ```
  This operation switches the values of `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`.

#### **How the Sorting Works:**
- The loops compare all elements in the array, and each time the inner loop finds an element that is **larger** than the current element (based on the `arr[i] < arr[j]` condition), the elements are swapped.
- This process continues for every pair of elements in the array until all elements are rearranged into **ascending order**.

### **Example Walkthrough:**

Letâ€™s trace what happens with the given input array:

1. **Initial array:**
   ```
   [4, 3, 2, -1, 3, 2]
   ```

2. **First iteration (i=0):**
   - The outer loop starts with `i = 0` and the inner loop runs through all elements of the array.
   - After comparing and swapping the elements as needed, the array looks like this:
   ```
   [-1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 2]
   ```
   (After comparing `4` with `-1`, `3`, `2`, and swapping them accordingly.)

3. **Second iteration (i=1):**
   - The outer loop continues with `i = 1` and the inner loop runs again.
   - The array looks like:
   ```
   [-1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2]
   ```

4. **Subsequent iterations:**
   - The program repeats the process for `i = 2, 3, 4, 5`, each time comparing and swapping elements to rearrange the array.

5. **Final sorted array:**
   - After the loops finish running, the array is sorted in **ascending order**:
   ```
   [-1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]
   ```

---

### **Final Output:**
```go
fmt.Println(arr)
```
- After all the iterations and swaps, the sorted array is printed:
  ```
  [-1 2 2 3 3 4]
  ```

---

### **Key Points to Note:**

1. **Nested Loops:**
   - The program uses **nested loops** to compare each element with every other element. This results in a time complexity of **O(nÂ²)**, which is characteristic of **bubble sort** or **selection sort**.

2. **Swapping Elements:**
   - The elements are swapped using the tuple assignment `arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]`. This effectively swaps the two values in the array.

3. **Inefficient Sorting Algorithm:**
   - This is an inefficient sorting algorithm because it compares each element with every other element multiple times. There are more optimized sorting algorithms like **quick sort** or **merge sort**, which perform better with large datasets.

---

### **Improvements:**

To optimize the sorting, you can use **Goâ€™s built-in sorting package**:

```go
import "sort"

func main() {
    arr := []int{4, 3, 2, -1, 3, 2}
    sort.Ints(arr)  // This sorts the array in ascending order
    fmt.Println(arr)
}
```

This would use a more efficient sorting algorithm, such as **quick sort** or **heap sort**, and will sort the array much faster.
