Let's break down the Go code you've provided, step by step, to understand how it works.

### **Step-by-step Explanation:**

### 1. **Initialization of the Array:**
```go
numbers := [...]int{10, 8, 1, 2, 3, 45, 12, 20}
n := len(numbers)
```
- Here, we define an **array** called `numbers` containing the integers:
  ```
  [10, 8, 1, 2, 3, 45, 12, 20]
  ```
- The `len(numbers)` function calculates the length of the array (the number of elements in the array). In this case, the length is `8`, so `n = 8`.

---

### 2. **Summing Even Numbers in the Array:**
```go
sumi := 0
for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
    if numbers[i]%2 == 0 {
        sumi = sumi + numbers[i]
    }
}
fmt.Println(sumi)
```

- **Goal:** We want to calculate the sum of only the even numbers in the array.
  
- **For Loop:**
  - The loop starts with `i = 0` and runs until `i < n` (i.e., from `i = 0` to `i = 7`, inclusive).
  - `numbers[i]` represents the **current element** of the array.
  
- **Even Number Check:**
  - The condition `if numbers[i]%2 == 0` checks if the current number is even.
  - If the number is even (i.e., `numbers[i] % 2 == 0`), then the code inside the `if` statement is executed. In this case, it adds the current number (`numbers[i]`) to the variable `sumi`, which keeps track of the sum of the even numbers.

- **Array elements considered for sum:**
  - **Even numbers:** 10, 8, 2, 12, 20.
  
- **Sum Calculation:**
  - The sum of these even numbers is:
    ```
    10 + 8 + 2 + 12 + 20 = 52
    ```
  
- **Result:**
  - The sum of even numbers is printed using `fmt.Println(sumi)`, which outputs:
    ```
    52
    ```

---

### 3. **Summing the First and Last Number:**
```go
c := numbers[0] + numbers[n-1]
fmt.Println(c)
```

- **Goal:** We want to calculate the sum of the first and the last number in the array.

- **First and Last Number:**
  - `numbers[0]` gives the **first element** of the array, which is `10`.
  - `numbers[n-1]` gives the **last element** of the array. Since `n = 8`, `numbers[7]` (i.e., the 8th element) is `20`.

- **Sum Calculation:**
  - The sum of the first and last numbers is:
    ```
    10 + 20 = 30
    ```
  
- **Result:**
  - The sum of the first and last numbers is printed using `fmt.Println(c)`, which outputs:
    ```
    30
    ```

---

### **Final Output:**
When the program is run, the output will be:

```
52
30
```

- **52** is the sum of the even numbers in the array.
- **30** is the sum of the first and last numbers in the array.

---

### **Summary of the Program:**

1. The program calculates the sum of **only the even numbers** in the array (`numbers[]`).
2. It then calculates the sum of the **first and last elements** of the array.
3. Finally, it prints both sums.

### **Key Concepts and Notes:**

- **Arrays in Go:** Arrays have a fixed size, and we use the `len()` function to find the number of elements in the array.
- **Modulus Operator (`%`):** The modulus operator is used to check if a number is even or odd. For even numbers, `number % 2 == 0`.
- **Accessing Array Elements:** You can access an array element using the index, like `numbers[i]`, where `i` is the index (starting from 0).
- **Looping through Arrays:** The `for` loop is commonly used to iterate through the array.
