### **Explanation of the Code**

This Go program demonstrates how to **initialize, access, and modify a map**.

### **1. Initializing a Map**
```go
var people1 = map[string]int{
	"Tom":   1,
	"Bob":   2,
	"Sam":   4,
	"Alice": 8,
}
```
- A map `people1` is created, where:
  - The keys are **strings** (e.g., `"Tom"`, `"Bob"`, `"Sam"`, `"Alice"`).
  - The values are **integers** representing some associated data.
- The map contains the following key-value pairs:
  ```
  "Tom" â†’ 1
  "Bob" â†’ 2
  "Sam" â†’ 4
  "Alice" â†’ 8
  ```

---

### **2. Accessing Values from the Map**
```go
fmt.Println(people1["Alice"]) // 8
fmt.Println(people1["Bob"])   // 2
```
- `people1["Alice"]` returns the value associated with the key `"Alice"`, which is `8`.
- `people1["Bob"]` returns the value associated with the key `"Bob"`, which is `2`.
- **Output:**
  ```
  8
  2
  ```

---

### **3. Modifying a Value in the Map**
```go
people1["Bob"] = 32
fmt.Println(people1["Bob"]) // 32
```
- `people1["Bob"] = 32` **modifies the value** associated with the key `"Bob"`, changing it from `2` to `32`.
- After the modification, when you print `people1["Bob"]`, it shows the updated value `32`.
- **Output:**
  ```
  32
  ```

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Initializing Maps:** You can initialize a map using the `map[keyType]valueType{}` syntax.
2. **Accessing Values:** Access map values using `map[key]`. If the key exists, the corresponding value is returned.
3. **Modifying Maps:** You can **update values** by assigning a new value to an existing key (`map[key] = newValue`).
4. **Zero Value Behavior:** If a key is not present in the map, it returns the **zero value** of the value type (in this case, `0` for integers).
