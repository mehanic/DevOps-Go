### **Explanation of the Code**
This Go program demonstrates **element-wise multiplication of two slices** using a custom function (`customMap`). The program ensures that it only processes elements up to the length of the shorter slice to prevent out-of-range errors.

---

## **1. Multiply Function**
```go
func multiply(x, y int) int {
	return x * y
}
```
- This function **takes two integers** (`x` and `y`) and **returns their product**.
- It is used inside `customMap` for element-wise multiplication.

---

## **2. Custom Map Function**
```go
func customMap(xs, ys []int) []int {
	// Determine the length of the smaller slice to avoid out-of-range errors
	length := len(xs)
	if len(ys) < length {
		length = len(ys)
	}

	result := make([]int, length) // Create a new slice to store the results
	for i := 0; i < length; i++ {
		result[i] = multiply(xs[i], ys[i]) // Multiply corresponding elements
	}
	return result
}
```
### **How It Works:**
- **Takes two slices (`xs`, `ys`) as input.**
- **Determines the length of the smaller slice** to prevent accessing out-of-range elements.
- **Creates a new slice** `result` to store the multiplication results.
- **Iterates through both slices**, multiplying corresponding elements and storing the results.
- **Returns the new slice** with multiplied values.

## **3. Test Function**
```go
func test() {
	xs := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
	ys := []int{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
	resultList := customMap(xs, ys)
	fmt.Println(resultList)
}
```
### **How It Works:**
- Initializes **two slices**, `xs` and `ys`, of different lengths.
- Calls `customMap(xs, ys)`, which multiplies corresponding elements **until the shorter slice (`ys`) is exhausted**.
- Prints the resulting slice.

---

## **4. Main Function**
```go
func main() {
	test()
}
```
- Calls the `test()` function to execute and print the results.

---

## **Output**
```
[2 6 12 20 30 42]
```
### **How the output is generated:**
- The two input slices:
  ```go
  xs := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
  ys := []int{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
  ```
- Only **6 elements** are processed (because `ys` has only 6 elements).
- Element-wise multiplication:
  ```
  1 * 2 = 2
  2 * 3 = 6
  3 * 4 = 12
  4 * 5 = 20
  5 * 6 = 30
  6 * 7 = 42
  ```
- The remaining elements in `xs` (7 and 8) are ignored because `ys` doesn't have corresponding elements.

## **Key Takeaways**
âœ… **Element-wise operations:** `customMap` applies multiplication to corresponding elements in two slices.  
âœ… **Avoiding out-of-range errors:** It processes elements only up to the length of the shorter slice.  
âœ… **Immutability:** The original slices remain unchanged; a new slice is returned.  
âœ… **Reusability:** The `multiply` function can be swapped out for other operations (e.g., addition, subtraction).
