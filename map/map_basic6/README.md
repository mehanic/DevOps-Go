This Go program works with a slice of integers (`arr`) and performs various operations with a map (`x_map`) to find out how many times a specific element (in this case, the integer `n`) appears in the slice. Let's break down the code and explain each step.

### **Code Explanation:**

```go
var arr = []int{1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 20}
var n = 4
var is int
var x_map = make(map[int]int)
```

1. **Initialization of Variables**:
   - `arr` is a slice of integers with some repeated and unique values.
   - `n` is an integer (set to `4`) whose frequency we want to check in the `arr` slice.
   - `is` is an integer variable initialized to `0`, which will later hold the result based on the conditions.
   - `x_map` is a map of type `map[int]int` that will store the frequency count of each number in the `arr` slice.

### **Step 1: Counting Occurrences of Elements in the Slice (`arr`)**

```go
for _, el := range arr {
    x_map[el]++
}
```

- This loop iterates over the `arr` slice.
- For each element (`el`) in `arr`, the map `x_map` increments the corresponding value (which represents the frequency) for that element.

After this loop runs, the `x_map` will look like:
```go
map[1:1 2:1 4:2 5:1 6:1 7:1 12:1 20:1]
```

This means:
- The number `4` appears **2 times**,
- The other numbers appear **1 time**.

### **Step 2: Checking the Conditions and Setting the Result (`is`)**

```go
for key, val := range x_map {
    if val == 1 && n == key {
        is = -1
    } else if val > 1 && key == n {
        is = x_map[n]
    }
}
```

- **Looping Over the `x_map`**:
  - The loop goes through the `x_map` and checks for specific conditions for the element `n` (which is `4` in this case).

#### **First Condition:**
```go
if val == 1 && n == key {
    is = -1
}
```
- This condition checks if an element appears exactly **once** (`val == 1`) and if the element matches the value of `n` (i.e., `key == n`).
- If both conditions are true, it sets the variable `is` to `-1`.

However, this condition **will not execute** for the number `4` because `4` appears **2 times** in the array, so the condition is not satisfied.

#### **Second Condition:**
```go
else if val > 1 && key == n {
    is = x_map[n]
}
```
- This condition checks if an element appears more than **once** (`val > 1`) and if the element matches the value of `n` (i.e., `key == n`).
- If both conditions are true, it sets the variable `is` to the frequency of `n` (i.e., `x_map[n]`).

This condition **will execute** for `n = 4`, because:
- `4` appears **2 times** (`val > 1`),
- The element `key` matches `n` (`key == 4`).

Thus, `is` will be set to `2` (the frequency of `4` in the map).

### **Step 3: Printing the Result**

```go
fmt.Println(is)
```

- Finally, the value of `is` is printed.
- Since `4` appears **2 times**, the value of `is` will be `2`, and the program will print:
```go
2
```

### **Summary of the Conditions and Behavior:**
- **If `n` is in the array and appears exactly once**, `is` is set to `-1`.
- **If `n` is in the array and appears more than once**, `is` is set to the number of occurrences (`x_map[n]`).
- **If `n` is not in the array**, the value of `is` remains `0` (the default initial value).

### **Example Outputs:**
1. **When `n = 4`:**
   - Since `4` appears **2 times**, the output will be:
   ```go
   2
   ```
   
2. **When `n = 10`:**
   - If you change `n` to `10`, since `10` is not in the array, the output will be:
   ```go
   0
   ```

### **Time Complexity:**
- **Counting occurrences**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the slice `arr` (because we are iterating through all elements of `arr` to populate `x_map`).
- **Checking conditions**: O(m), where `m` is the number of unique elements in the map `x_map`.

Overall, the time complexity of this program is O(n + m), where `n` is the length of the slice and `m` is the number of unique keys in the map.
