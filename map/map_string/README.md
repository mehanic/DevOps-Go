### Explanation of the Code:

This Go program demonstrates the use of maps with different key-value pair types, including a map with an integer key and a string value, and a map with a string key and a slice of strings as the value.

---

### **1. Map with Integer Key and String Value**
```go
fruits := map[int]string{1: "mango", 2: "Orange"}
fmt.Println(fruits)
```

- **Explanation:**
  - A map `fruits` is created with `int` as the key type and `string` as the value type.
  - The map has two entries: `1: "mango"` and `2: "Orange"`.
  - The `fmt.Println(fruits)` prints the entire map, which will be displayed in some random order because Go maps are unordered collections.
  
- **Output:**
  ```
  map[1:mango 2:Orange]
  ```

---

### **2. Map with String Key and Slice of Strings as Values**
```go
students := map[string][]string{
    "ss1": {"John", "Ade"},
    "ss2": {"John", "Ade"},
}
```

- **Explanation:**
  - A map `students` is created with a `string` as the key type and a slice of strings (`[]string`) as the value type.
  - This map represents student groups where the keys (`"ss1"`, `"ss2"`) represent the student group IDs, and the values are slices of strings containing the names of students in each group.
  - The map contains two entries: 
    - `"ss1": {"John", "Ade"}`
    - `"ss2": {"John", "Ade"}`
  
- **Output (only the map declaration, no print yet):**
  - The map is stored as:
    ```
    map[ss1:[John Ade] ss2:[John Ade]]
    ```

---

### **3. Accessing a Specific Value in the Map**
```go
ss1Students := students["ss1"]
fmt.Println(ss1Students)
```

- **Explanation:**
  - The value associated with the key `"ss1"` is fetched from the `students` map using `students["ss1"]`.
  - This value is a slice `{"John", "Ade"}`. This slice is assigned to the variable `ss1Students`.
  - The `fmt.Println(ss1Students)` prints this slice.
  
- **Output:**
  ```
  [John Ade]
  ```

---

### **4. Printing the Entire Map**
```go
fmt.Println(students)
```

- **Explanation:**
  - This prints the entire `students` map. The map contains two entries: `"ss1": {"John", "Ade"}` and `"ss2": {"John", "Ade"}`.
  - Go maps do not guarantee a particular order when printed, so the output can be in any order.

- **Output:**
  ```
  map[ss1:[John Ade] ss2:[John Ade]]
  ```

### **Key Concepts in the Code:**

1. **Map Declaration with Integer Keys and String Values:**
   - `fruits := map[int]string{1: "mango", 2: "Orange"}` creates a map where the key is an integer and the value is a string. The map is unordered, so the order in which the entries are printed may not match the insertion order.

2. **Map with String Keys and Slice of Strings as Values:**
   - `students := map[string][]string{"ss1": {"John", "Ade"}, "ss2": {"John", "Ade"}}` defines a map where each key is a string (representing a group ID), and each value is a slice of strings (representing students in that group).

3. **Accessing Values in Maps:**
   - The value for a specific key can be accessed using the syntax `map[key]`, as seen in the line `ss1Students := students["ss1"]`.

4. **Printing Maps and Slices:**
   - `fmt.Println()` is used to print both maps and slices. When printing maps, the output order of key-value pairs is not guaranteed. The `fmt.Println(ss1Students)` outputs the slice directly, showing its contents.

---

### **Summary of the Output:**

1. **Map `fruits`:**
   ```
   map[1:mango 2:Orange]
   ```

2. **Students in Group `"ss1"`:**
   ```
   [John Ade]
   ```

3. **The Entire `students` Map:**
   ```
   map[ss1:[John Ade] ss2:[John Ade]]
   ```

---

### **Important Notes:**
- Maps in Go are **unordered** collections. The order of the elements when printed may vary.
- The value type of a map can be any type, including slices or other complex data structures.
- When accessing a map with `map[key]`, if the key does not exist, it returns the zero value for that type and a `false` boolean (not used in this case).
