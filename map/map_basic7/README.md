This Go code contains three main functions that demonstrate different techniques for looping and accumulating sums. Let's go through each function step by step to explain how they work.

### **`main()` Function**
```go
func main() {
	var sum int

	// sum += 1
	// sum += 2
	// sum += 3
	// sum += 4
	// sum += 5

	for i := 1; i <= 1000; i++ {
		sum += i
	}

	fmt.Println(sum)
	main1()
	main2()
	main3()
}
```
- This function initializes a variable `sum` and runs a `for` loop from `1` to `1000`.
- Inside the loop, the variable `i` is added to `sum` in each iteration.
- At the end of the loop, it prints the final `sum`, which is the sum of the numbers from `1` to `1000`.
  
**Explanation:**
- The sum of numbers from 1 to 1000 is calculated and printed, which is `500500` (this is the sum of an arithmetic series: \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), where \(n = 1000\)).
- Then, it calls the functions `main1()`, `main2()`, and `main3()` to run them one by one.

**Output:**
```
500500
```

### **`main1()` Function**
```go
func main1() {
	var (
		sum int
		i   = 1
	)

	for {
		if i > 5 {
			break
		}

		sum += i

		fmt.Println(i, "-->", sum)

		i++
	}

	fmt.Println(sum)
}
```
- This function uses an **infinite `for` loop** (`for {}`), which will continue executing indefinitely unless explicitly stopped with a `break` statement.
- It starts with `i = 1` and keeps adding `i` to `sum` in each iteration.
- When `i` becomes greater than `5`, the `if i > 5` condition will be true, and the loop will be exited using `break`.
- The value of `i` and the accumulated `sum` are printed in each iteration, and after the loop ends, the final `sum` is printed.

**Explanation:**
- The loop runs until `i` exceeds `5`.
- In each iteration, `sum` is incremented by `i`, and both `i` and `sum` are printed.
  
**Output:**
```
1 --> 1
2 --> 3
3 --> 6
4 --> 10
5 --> 15
15
```

### **`main2()` Function**
```go
func main2() {
	var (
		sum int
		i   = 3
	)

	for {
		if i > 10 {
			break
		}

		if i%2 != 0 {
			// this continue creates an endless loop
			// since the code never increases the i
			continue
		}

		sum += i

		fmt.Println(i, "-->", sum)

		i++
	}

	fmt.Println(sum)
}
```
- This function is similar to `main1()`, but with a key difference: it starts `i` at `3` and uses a `continue` statement to skip even numbers.
- If `i` is odd (`i%2 != 0`), the `continue` statement is executed, skipping the current iteration. However, the issue here is that the `i` variable is **not incremented** in the `continue` path, leading to an **infinite loop**. The loop never progresses past an odd value of `i`.
- The `continue` statement makes the loop never progress with odd values, and since `i` is not incremented inside that block, the loop does not move forward, resulting in an infinite loop.

**Explanation of the Bug:**
- The code never increases `i` when `i%2 != 0`, causing the loop to keep checking the same odd value repeatedly and thus never stopping.

**Fixed Output (if the bug is fixed):**
```
6 --> 6
8 --> 14
10 --> 24
24
```

### **`main3()` Function**
```go
func main3() {
	var (
		sum int
		i   = 1
	)

	for {
		if i > 10 {
			break
		}

		if i%2 != 0 {
			// just by putting this here we solve the problem
			i++
			continue
		}

		sum += i

		fmt.Println(i, "-->", sum)

		i++
	}

	fmt.Println(sum)
}
```
- This function is similar to `main2()`, but with a **fix** to prevent the infinite loop:
  - The `i++` is now placed before the `continue` statement, so even if `i` is odd, the value of `i` will increment, allowing the loop to continue and eventually reach even values.
- The loop runs until `i > 10`, and for every even `i`, `sum` is incremented.
  
**Explanation of the Fix:**
- In `main3()`, the fix is applied by incrementing `i` before the `continue` statement when `i` is odd. This prevents the infinite loop and ensures that the loop progresses as intended.
  
**Output:**
```
2 --> 2
4 --> 6
6 --> 12
8 --> 20
10 --> 30
30
```

### **Summary of Each Function:**

1. **`main()`**: Computes the sum of integers from 1 to 1000, which results in `500500`.
2. **`main1()`**: Accumulates the sum of numbers from `1` to `5` and prints the intermediate sums.
3. **`main2()`**: Has an issue where the loop doesn't increment `i` for odd numbers, resulting in an infinite loop.
4. **`main3()`**: Fixes the issue from `main2()` by incrementing `i` before continuing for odd numbers, correctly summing even numbers.

The key issue in **`main2()`** is the `continue` statement skipping the increment of `i` for odd numbers, leading to an infinite loop. The fix in **`main3()`** properly ensures that `i` is incremented before skipping iterations.
