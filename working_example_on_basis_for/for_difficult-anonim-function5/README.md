Let's break down the Go code to understand how it works.

### Code Overview:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func pow2(n int) {
    var x = 1
    for x <= n {
        x *= 2
        if x <= n {
            fmt.Println(x)
        }
    }
}

func main() {
    pow2(10)
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **`pow2` function**:
    ```go
    func pow2(n int) {
        var x = 1
        for x <= n {
            x *= 2
            if x <= n {
                fmt.Println(x)
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    - The `pow2` function takes an integer `n` as an argument and prints powers of 2 that are less than or equal to `n`.
    
    **Detailed logic**:
    - It starts with a variable `x` initialized to `1`.
    - It then enters a `for` loop that continues as long as `x <= n`.
    - Inside the loop:
        - `x *= 2` doubles the value of `x` on each iteration (this effectively computes the powers of 2).
        - The `if x <= n` condition ensures that only values of `x` that are less than or equal to `n` will be printed.
    - For each iteration where `x <= n`, it prints the current value of `x`.

2. **`main` function**:
    ```go
    func main() {
        pow2(10)
    }
    ```
    - The `main` function calls the `pow2` function with an argument `10`.
    - This means the program will print the powers of 2 that are less than or equal to `10`.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Initial value of `x`**: 1
- The loop starts, and the first iteration doubles `x` to `2`.
  - `x` is now `2`, which is less than or equal to `10`, so `2` is printed.
- In the next iteration, `x` becomes `4` (since `2 * 2 = 4`).
  - `x` is now `4`, which is still less than or equal to `10`, so `4` is printed.
- The next iteration gives `x = 8` (since `4 * 2 = 8`).
  - `x` is now `8`, which is less than or equal to `10`, so `8` is printed.
- In the next iteration, `x = 16` (since `8 * 2 = 16`).
  - Now, `x` is `16`, which is greater than `10`, so the loop stops.

### Final Output:
```
2
4
8
```

### Summary of the Flow:
1. Start with `x = 1`.
2. Double `x` in each iteration of the loop (`x *= 2`).
3. Print the value of `x` as long as `x` is less than or equal to `n`.
4. Stop the loop when `x` exceeds `n`.

### Points to Note:
- The `x *= 2` operation ensures that `x` follows the sequence of powers of 2: `1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...`.
- The `if x <= n` ensures that the program prints only the values of `x` that are less than or equal to `n`.
- The loop will stop when `x` exceeds `n`, thus only printing the relevant powers of 2.
