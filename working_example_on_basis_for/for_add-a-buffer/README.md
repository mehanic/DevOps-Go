This Go program is designed to create and render a simple 2D board representation of a smiley face using a buffer. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### 1. **Constants Declaration**:
```go
const (
	width  = 50
	height = 10

	cellEmpty = ' '
	cellBall  = '⚾'
)
```
- `width` and `height` define the dimensions of the board (50 columns and 10 rows).
- `cellEmpty` represents an empty cell (a space).
- `cellBall` represents a cell with a ball (⚾), which is used to draw the smiley face.

---

### 2. **Creating the Board**:
```go
board := make([][]bool, width)
for column := range board {
	board[column] = make([]bool, height)
}
```
- The `board` is a 2D slice (`[][]bool`). Each element is a boolean value (`true` or `false`), representing whether a cell is filled (`true`) or empty (`false`).
- The loop initializes each column with a slice of boolean values (one for each row).

---

### 3. **Drawing the Smiley Face**:
```go
board[12][2] = true
board[16][2] = true
board[14][4] = true
board[10][6] = true
board[18][6] = true
board[12][7] = true
board[14][7] = true
board[16][7] = true
```
- These specific coordinates correspond to positions on the board where the cells are set to `true`, forming the shape of a smiley face.

---

### 4. **Creating the Buffer**:
```go
buf := make([]rune, 0, width*height)
```
- A `buf` (buffer) is created as a slice of runes (characters). Its capacity is set to `width * height`, which is the total number of cells on the board.
- This buffer allows efficient construction of the output before printing, which improves performance.

---

### 5. **Rendering the Board Multiple Times**:
```go
for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {
```
- The outer loop repeats the drawing process 100 times to measure performance.

---

### 6. **Resetting the Buffer**:
```go
buf = buf[:0]
```
- This clears the buffer for each iteration to avoid creating a new slice, which improves memory efficiency.

---

### 7. **Drawing the Board into the Buffer**:
```go
for y := range board[0] {
	for x := range board {
		cell = cellEmpty
		if board[x][y] {
			cell = cellBall
		}
		buf = append(buf, cell, ' ')
	}
	buf = append(buf, '\n')
}
```
- Nested loops iterate through each cell (`x`, `y`) on the board.
- If the cell is `true`, it sets `cell` to the ball (`⚾`). Otherwise, it uses an empty space.
- The character (either `⚾` or empty) is appended to the buffer, followed by a space to visually separate cells.
- A newline (`\n`) is appended at the end of each row to create the 2D grid structure.

---

### 8. **Printing the Buffer**:
```go
fmt.Print(string(buf))
```
- The buffer, now containing the entire board, is printed as a string. This approach is much faster than printing cell-by-cell using `fmt.Print`.

---

### ✅ **Output**:
A smiley face made of ⚾ symbols is printed 100 times, with the rest of the cells empty. This approach leverages a buffer for performance and reduces the time spent on I/O operations.
