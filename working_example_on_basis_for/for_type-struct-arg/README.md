Let's break down the Go program step by step to explain the functionality and the rules it follows:

### Program Overview:

This Go program simulates an anonymous survey where users are asked a question, can input their responses, and at the end, the program displays the collected responses.

---

### Code Breakdown:

#### 1. **Defining the `AnonymousSurvey` struct**:

```go
type AnonymousSurvey struct {
	question  string
	responses []string
}
```

- **`AnonymousSurvey`**: A custom data type (struct) that holds:
  - `question`: A string representing the question for the survey.
  - `responses`: A slice of strings that stores the responses given by participants.

#### 2. **Methods for `AnonymousSurvey` struct**:

##### a. **Method to Show the Survey Question**:

```go
func (s *AnonymousSurvey) showQuestion() {
	fmt.Println(s.question)
}
```

- **Purpose**: This method prints the survey question to the console.
- It is a method attached to the `AnonymousSurvey` struct.
- It uses `s.question` (the `question` field of the struct) to print the question.

##### b. **Method to Store Responses**:

```go
func (s *AnonymousSurvey) storeResponse(response string) {
	s.responses = append(s.responses, response)
}
```

- **Purpose**: This method stores the user's response in the `responses` field of the struct.
- It appends the response string to the `responses` slice using the `append()` function.

##### c. **Method to Show Survey Results**:

```go
func (s *AnonymousSurvey) showResults() {
	fmt.Println("\nSurvey Results:")
	for _, response := range s.responses {
		fmt.Println("- " + response)
	}
}
```

- **Purpose**: This method prints the collected survey results.
- It iterates over the `responses` slice and prints each response.

#### 3. **Main Function**:

```go
func main() {
	// Define a question, and make a survey
	question := "What language did you first learn to speak?"
	mySurvey := AnonymousSurvey{question: question}

	// Show the question, and store responses
	mySurvey.showQuestion()
	fmt.Println("Enter 'q' at any time to quit.\n")
```

- **Purpose**: The `main()` function sets up the survey.
- It initializes the `question` variable with a string, and creates an instance `mySurvey` of the `AnonymousSurvey` struct, passing the `question` to it.

```go
reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
```

- **Purpose**: This creates a new `bufio.Reader` to read input from the user. It reads from the standard input (`os.Stdin`).

```go
for {
	// Read input from the user
	fmt.Print("Language: ")
	response, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
	response = strings.TrimSpace(response)

	if response == "q" {
		break
	}

	// Store the response
	mySurvey.storeResponse(response)
}
```

- **Purpose**: This `for` loop continuously asks for user input (the response to the survey question) until the user enters `"q"`.
  - `fmt.Print("Language: ")`: Prints the prompt asking for a response.
  - `response, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')`: Reads the user's input and stores it in the `response` variable.
  - `strings.TrimSpace(response)`: Removes leading and trailing whitespace from the response (including the newline character).
  - If the response is `"q"`, the loop breaks, ending the survey input.
  - Otherwise, the response is stored by calling `mySurvey.storeResponse(response)`.

```go
fmt.Println("\nThank you to everyone who participated in the survey!")
mySurvey.showResults()
```

- **Purpose**: After exiting the loop (when `"q"` is entered), the program prints a "Thank you" message and then calls `mySurvey.showResults()` to display all the responses collected in the survey.

---

### Summary of Program Flow:

1. **Define Survey**: The survey question is defined as `"What language did you first learn to speak?"`, and an empty slice of responses is set up to hold user input.
   
2. **User Interaction**:
   - The question is shown to the user.
   - The program enters a loop where it continuously asks the user to input a response (language they first learned to speak).
   - The loop continues until the user enters `"q"`.
   
3. **Store Responses**:
   - Responses are stored in the `responses` field of the `AnonymousSurvey` struct.
   - The responses are appended to the slice `responses` as they come in.
   
4. **Display Results**:
   - After the user quits the survey (by entering `"q"`), the program thanks the user and shows all the collected responses.

### Example Input/Output:

#### Example Input:

```
What language did you first learn to speak?
Enter 'q' at any time to quit.

Language: chinese
Language: uk
Language: q

Thank you to everyone who participated in the survey!

Survey Results:
- chinese
- uk
```

- The user inputs `"chinese"`, `"uk"`, and then `"q"`, signaling the end of the survey.
- The program displays all the responses collected in the survey.

### Key Points:
1. **Structs and Methods**: The `AnonymousSurvey` struct is used to represent the survey, and methods are defined to interact with the struct (show question, store responses, and show results).
2. **User Input and Loops**: The program uses a loop to get responses from the user and allows them to quit by entering `"q"`.
3. **Error Handling**: While not explicitly handled in this code, potential errors in user input (such as invalid strings) could be managed with error checks.
