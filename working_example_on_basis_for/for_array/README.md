This Go program calculates the **sum of the elements in an array** and prints the result.

---

## âœ… **Step-by-step explanation:**

### 1. **Array Declaration and Initialization**
```go
numbers := [...]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
```
- The `numbers` array is created with **5 elements: `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`**.
- The `[...]` syntax allows the compiler to **automatically determine the length** of the array based on the provided elements. In this case, it's **5 elements**.

---

### 2. **Variable for Storing the Sum**
```go
sumi := 0
```
- The variable `sumi` is initialized to **0**. 
- This will store the **cumulative sum** of the array elements.

---

### 3. **For Loop to Iterate Over the Array**
```go
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
	sumi = sumi + numbers[i]
}
```
- The loop runs **5 times**, starting from `i = 0` to `i = 4`.
- In each iteration, the value of `numbers[i]` (the element at index `i`) is added to `sumi`.
- This is an **accumulator pattern**, which is used to sum the elements of the array.

---

### 4. **Print the Result**
```go
fmt.Println(sumi)
```
- After the loop finishes, the **total sum `sumi`** is printed to the console.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Example of how it works:**
| Iteration | `numbers[i]` | `sumi` (cumulative sum) |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------|
| 1st (i=0) | 1             | 0 + 1 = 1          |
| 2nd (i=1) | 2             | 1 + 2 = 3          |
| 3rd (i=2) | 3             | 3 + 3 = 6          |
| 4th (i=3) | 4             | 6 + 4 = 10         |
| 5th (i=4) | 5             | 10 + 5 = 15        |

---

## âœ… **Final Output**
```
15
```

---

## ðŸ“Œ **General Rule:**
This program demonstrates how to **sum the elements of an array using a loop**.
