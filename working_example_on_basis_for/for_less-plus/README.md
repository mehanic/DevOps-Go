Let's break down the code and explain how the loop works:

### Full Code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// i=0 счетчик
	// i<5
	// i=i+1 -> i+=1 -> i++
	// for создаем счетчик; условия работы счетчика; условия изменения счетчика{
	//   действие1
	//   действие2
	// }
	// i=0 +
	// i=2 +
	// i=4 +
	// i=6
	fmt.Println("for start")
	for i := 0; i < 5; i+=2 {
		fmt.Println("Yerassyl")
	}
	fmt.Println("for end")
}
```

### Explanation:

#### 1. **The `for` loop structure**:
   The `for` loop in Go has the following structure:

   ```go
   for initialization; condition; post-action {
       // actions (statements to be executed during each iteration)
   }
   ```

   In your code, this structure is:

   ```go
   for i := 0; i < 5; i+=2 {
       fmt.Println("Yerassyl")
   }
   ```

   - **Initialization**: `i := 0` - This initializes the counter `i` to 0. It only happens once at the start of the loop.
   - **Condition**: `i < 5` - This condition is checked before each iteration. If `i` is less than 5, the loop will run. When `i` becomes 5 or greater, the loop stops.
   - **Post-action**: `i+=2` - This means that after each iteration, `i` will be incremented by 2. It can also be written as `i = i + 2` or `i++`.

#### 2. **Flow of the Loop**:

   - **First iteration**:
     - `i = 0`
     - The condition `i < 5` is true (`0 < 5`).
     - `fmt.Println("Yerassyl")` prints `"Yerassyl"`.
     - After this iteration, `i` is incremented by 2 (`i = i + 2`), so `i` becomes 2.

   - **Second iteration**:
     - `i = 2`
     - The condition `i < 5` is still true (`2 < 5`).
     - `fmt.Println("Yerassyl")` prints `"Yerassyl"`.
     - After this iteration, `i` is incremented by 2 (`i = i + 2`), so `i` becomes 4.

   - **Third iteration**:
     - `i = 4`
     - The condition `i < 5` is still true (`4 < 5`).
     - `fmt.Println("Yerassyl")` prints `"Yerassyl"`.
     - After this iteration, `i` is incremented by 2 (`i = i + 2`), so `i` becomes 6.

   - **Loop termination**:
     - Now `i = 6`.
     - The condition `i < 5` is no longer true (`6 < 5` is false), so the loop terminates.

#### 3. **Output**:
   The loop runs 3 times, and during each iteration, it prints `"Yerassyl"`. Therefore, the output will be:

   ```
   for start
   Yerassyl
   Yerassyl
   Yerassyl
   for end
   ```

#### 4. **Key points**:
   - The loop uses the `i++` shorthand (`i += 2`), which increments the loop counter by 2 after each iteration.
   - The loop will stop when the condition (`i < 5`) is no longer true.
   - The program prints `"Yerassyl"` three times (for `i = 0`, `i = 2`, and `i = 4`).

### Conclusion:
- The `for` loop in this code starts with `i = 0`, runs as long as `i < 5`, and increases `i` by 2 after each iteration. It prints `"Yerassyl"` three times, one for each value of `i` (0, 2, and 4).
