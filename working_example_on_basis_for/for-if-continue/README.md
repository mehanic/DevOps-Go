This Go program uses a `for` loop with a `continue` statement. Let's break down the code and explain what happens:

### Code Breakdown:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    for i := 0; i <= 10; i++ {
        if i == 5 {
            continue
        }
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
}
```

### 1. `for i := 0; i <= 10; i++`:
- This is the start of a `for` loop, where:
  - `i := 0`: Initializes the variable `i` to 0.
  - `i <= 10`: Specifies the condition for the loop to continue, meaning the loop will run as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10.
  - `i++`: Increments `i` by 1 after each iteration.

The loop will iterate 11 times (from `i = 0` to `i = 10`).

### 2. `if i == 5 { continue }`:
- Inside the loop, there's an `if` statement that checks if `i == 5`.
- If `i` is equal to 5, the `continue` statement is executed. 
  - **`continue`**: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. This means any code below the `continue` statement is skipped for that particular iteration.
  - So, when `i` is 5, the program will skip the `fmt.Println(i)` statement and move directly to the next iteration (i.e., `i = 6`).

### 3. `fmt.Println(i)`:
- This function prints the value of `i` to the console, but only for those iterations where `i != 5` because the `continue` statement will skip the print when `i == 5`.

### What happens during execution:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 10`, and the `fmt.Println(i)` will print the value of `i` for each iteration, **except when `i == 5`**, as it will skip printing that value.
  
### Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
6
7
8
9
10
```

**Explanation of the output**:
- The loop prints values from `0` to `10`, skipping the value `5` due to the `continue` statement.
- When `i == 5`, the `continue` is executed, so the `fmt.Println(i)` for `i = 5` is skipped, and the loop moves to `i = 6`.

### Summary:
- The program iterates over the numbers 0 to 10.
- When `i == 5`, the `continue` statement skips the `fmt.Println(i)` and moves to the next iteration (i = 6).
- The program prints all the numbers from 0 to 10, except for 5.
