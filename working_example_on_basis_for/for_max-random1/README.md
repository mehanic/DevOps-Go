Let's break down the Go program you've provided step by step and explain the rules and logic behind it:

### Code Breakdown

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// задает максимальное число которое может быть рандомным
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UTC().UnixNano())

	n := 5
	a := []int{}
	chet := []int{}
	nechet := []int{}
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		k := rand.Intn(100)
		a = append(a, k)
	}
	fmt.Println(a)
	//sumi
	for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
		if a[i]%2 == 0 {
			chet = append(chet, a[i])
		} else {
			nechet = append(nechet, a[i])
		}
	}
	fmt.Println(chet)
	fmt.Println(nechet)
}
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Importing Packages**:
   - `import "fmt"`: The `fmt` package is used for formatted input and output. Here, it is used to print values to the console.
   - `import "math/rand"`: This imports the `rand` package, which is used to generate random numbers.
   - `import "time"`: This package is used to get the current time. In this program, it is used to seed the random number generator to ensure the numbers generated are random each time the program runs.

2. **Seeding the Random Number Generator**:
   - `rand.Seed(time.Now().UTC().UnixNano())`: This line sets the seed for generating random numbers. It uses the current Unix timestamp in nanoseconds (`time.Now().UTC().UnixNano()`) to ensure that the random numbers are different every time the program is executed.

3. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `n := 5`: This variable `n` determines how many random numbers will be generated (in this case, 5 numbers).
   - `a := []int{}`: This initializes an empty slice `a` where the random numbers will be stored.
   - `chet := []int{}`: This initializes an empty slice `chet` where the even numbers will be stored.
   - `nechet := []int{}`: This initializes an empty slice `nechet` where the odd numbers will be stored.

4. **Generating Random Numbers**:
   - `for i := 0; i < n; i++ { ... }`: This loop runs `n` times (in this case, 5 times) to generate random numbers.
     - `k := rand.Intn(100)`: This generates a random integer between `0` and `99`.
     - `a = append(a, k)`: The generated number `k` is appended to the slice `a`.
   - After this loop, the slice `a` contains 5 random numbers. The line `fmt.Println(a)` prints the slice `a` to the console.

5. **Categorizing Numbers into Even and Odd**:
   - `for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ { ... }`: This loop goes through each number in the slice `a` to classify it as either even or odd.
     - `if a[i] % 2 == 0 { ... }`: This checks if the current number `a[i]` is even. If the remainder of the number divided by 2 is `0`, it is even.
       - `chet = append(chet, a[i])`: If the number is even, it is added to the `chet` slice.
     - `else { ... }`: If the number is not even (i.e., it's odd), it is added to the `nechet` slice.
       - `nechet = append(nechet, a[i])`: This adds the odd number to the `nechet` slice.

6. **Printing the Results**:
   - `fmt.Println(chet)`: After categorizing the numbers, it prints the slice `chet` which contains all the even numbers.
   - `fmt.Println(nechet)`: It then prints the slice `nechet` which contains all the odd numbers.

### Example Execution:

Suppose the random numbers generated are:

```
[34 67 12 89 45]
```

The output would be:

```
[34 67 12 89 45]
[34 12]
[67 89 45]
```

Explanation:
- Random numbers generated: `[34, 67, 12, 89, 45]`.
- The even numbers (`chet`): `[34, 12]`.
- The odd numbers (`nechet`): `[67, 89, 45]`.

### Summary:

- **Random Number Generation**: The program generates 5 random integers between `0` and `99`.
- **Even and Odd Classification**: It classifies the numbers into two categories:
  - **Even** numbers (`chet`).
  - **Odd** numbers (`nechet`).
- **Printing**: Finally, the program prints the random numbers, the even numbers, and the odd numbers.

This program demonstrates how to generate random numbers, classify them as even or odd, and then store and print them in separate slices.
