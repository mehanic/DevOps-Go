Let's break down and explain the provided Go code in detail:

### Code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	// we initialize i to 0, and use postincrement (no preincrement)
	for i := 0; i <= 100; i++ {
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
}
```

### **Explanation of the Rules and Code Logic**:

1. **`package main`**:
   - This line declares that the program belongs to the `main` package. In Go, the `main` package is special because it defines the entry point for the program. The `main` function is the first function executed when the program starts.

2. **`import "fmt"`**:
   - The `import` statement is used to import the `fmt` package, which provides formatting and I/O functions, including `fmt.Println`, which is used to print output to the console.

3. **`func main()`**:
   - This is the entry point of the program. The `main` function is where the execution of the program starts.

4. **`for i := 0; i <= 100; i++`**:
   - This is a `for` loop in Go. A `for` loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code a set number of times.
   - **Loop structure**: A `for` loop has three parts:
     - **Initialization (`i := 0`)**: This sets the loop variable `i` to 0 at the start of the loop. This part is executed only once, before the loop begins.
     - **Condition (`i <= 100`)**: The loop continues to execute as long as this condition evaluates to `true`. In this case, the loop will run as long as `i` is less than or equal to 100.
     - **Post-increment (`i++`)**: After each iteration of the loop, the loop variable `i` is incremented by 1. The `++` operator is shorthand for `i = i + 1`. This is known as the **post-increment** because the increment happens after the loop body has executed.
   
5. **`fmt.Println(i)`**:
   - Inside the loop body, `fmt.Println(i)` is called to print the value of `i` during each iteration. This will print the value of `i` starting from 0 and continuing until 100 (inclusive).

### **Loop Behavior**:

- The `for` loop will start with `i = 0` and increment `i` by 1 on each iteration. It will continue to loop as long as `i <= 100`.
- Each time the loop runs, it will print the current value of `i`.
- When `i` reaches 100, it will print `100`, then increment to `101`. The condition `i <= 100` will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate.

### **Key Points**:

- **Post-increment (`i++`)**: The value of `i` is increased after the body of the loop runs, meaning `i` starts at 0, and increments by 1 after each iteration.
- The loop will print all numbers from 0 to 100 inclusive.
- The loop condition is checked before the body is executed in each iteration, and once `i` exceeds 100, the loop stops.

### **Example Output**:
```
0
1
2
3
...
99
100
```

### **Summary**:

- The code initializes `i` to 0, then runs a loop until `i` exceeds 100.
- In each iteration of the loop, `i` is printed and then incremented by 1.
- The loop will print integers from 0 to 100, each on a new line.
