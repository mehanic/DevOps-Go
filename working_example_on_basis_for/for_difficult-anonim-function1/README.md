Let's break down the Go code and explain the logic behind each part:

### Code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
	var arr = []int{1, 4, 8, -1, 9, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4}
	var min = arr[0]
	var count = 0
	for _, el := range arr {
		if min > el {
			min = el
		}
	}
	for _, el := range arr {
		if min == el {
			count++
		}
	}

	fmt.Printf("min:=%d  count:=%d\n", min, count)
}
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   ```go
   var arr = []int{1, 4, 8, -1, 9, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4}
   var min = arr[0]
   var count = 0
   ```
   - `arr`: A slice of integers, initialized with the values `{1, 4, 8, -1, 9, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.
   - `min`: A variable initialized to the first element of the array, `arr[0]`, which is `1`. This will be used to find the minimum value in the slice.
   - `count`: A variable initialized to `0`. This will count how many times the minimum value appears in the slice.

2. **Finding the Minimum Value**:
   ```go
   for _, el := range arr {
       if min > el {
           min = el
       }
   }
   ```
   - This `for` loop iterates over each element (`el`) in the slice `arr`.
   - For each element `el`, it checks if `min > el` (if the current `min` value is greater than the element `el`).
   - If it is, then `min` is updated to the value of `el`. This ensures that after the loop finishes, `min` will hold the smallest value found in the slice.
   - For example:
     - Initially, `min = 1`.
     - In the second iteration, it checks if `min > 4`. Since `1 < 4`, `min` remains `1`.
     - In the third iteration, it checks if `min > 8`. Again, `1 < 8`, so `min` remains `1`.
     - When it reaches `-1`, `min > -1`, so `min` is updated to `-1`.
     - After completing the loop, `min = -1`.

3. **Counting the Occurrences of the Minimum Value**:
   ```go
   for _, el := range arr {
       if min == el {
           count++
       }
   }
   ```
   - This second `for` loop iterates again over each element in `arr`.
   - For each element `el`, it checks if `min == el` (if the current element is equal to the minimum value).
   - If it is, it increments the `count` variable by 1. This way, the program counts how many times the minimum value appears in the slice.
   - For example:
     - Initially, `min = -1`.
     - The loop checks each element of `arr` and compares it to `min = -1`.
     - When it encounters `-1` in the array, it increments `count`.
     - The minimum value `-1` appears only once in the array, so `count` will be `1`.

4. **Final Output**:
   ```go
   fmt.Printf("min:=%d  count:=%d\n", min, count)
   ```
   - Finally, the program prints the minimum value found (`min`) and how many times it appears (`count`) in the slice `arr`.
   - In this case, the minimum value is `-1`, and it appears `1` time.
   - The output will be: `min:=-1  count:=1`

### Output:

```
min:=-1  count:=1
```

### Summary:
- The program finds the **minimum value** in the array `arr` using a `for` loop.
- After finding the minimum value, it counts how many times that value appears in the array.
- Finally, it prints the minimum value and its count.

### Key Concepts:
1. **`for` loop**: Goâ€™s `for` loop is used to iterate through elements in a slice or array.
2. **`min` variable**: The variable `min` is used to store the smallest value in the array.
3. **`count` variable**: This variable keeps track of how many times the minimum value appears in the array.
4. **Comparison**: The program compares each element in the slice to find the minimum value and then counts how many times it occurs.
