This Go program maintains a map of birthdays and allows the user to interact with it by adding or retrieving birthday information for various people. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

### 1. **Package Declarations**
```go
import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)
```
- `fmt`: The `fmt` package is used to format and print output (in this case, for printing messages to the console).
- `os`: The `os` package provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as reading from standard input (keyboard).
- `bufio`: The `bufio` package is used to read input efficiently from the console.

### 2. **Birthday Map**
```go
birthdays := map[string]string{
	"Alice": "Apr 1",
	"Bob":   "Dec 12",
	"Carol": "Mar 4",
}
```
- This line creates a `map` called `birthdays`. The keys of the map are strings representing the names of people (e.g., "Alice"), and the values are strings representing their birthdays (e.g., "Apr 1").

### 3. **Scanner Setup**
```go
scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
```
- `scanner` is initialized with `bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)`, which creates a new scanner that reads from the standard input (i.e., the keyboard).
- The `Scanner` will be used to get the input from the user during the program's execution.

### 4. **Main Program Loop**
```go
for {
	fmt.Print("Enter a name: (blank to quit)\n")
	scanner.Scan()
	name := scanner.Text()
	if name == "" {
		break
	}
```
- The `for` loop is an infinite loop that will keep running until the user chooses to exit.
- `fmt.Print("Enter a name: (blank to quit)\n")` asks the user to input a name or leave it blank to quit.
- `scanner.Scan()` reads the input from the user, and `name := scanner.Text()` stores the input string in the variable `name`.
- If the user enters a blank string (`name == ""`), the program breaks out of the loop and ends.

### 5. **Check if Birthday Exists**
```go
if bday, ok := birthdays[name]; ok {
	fmt.Printf("%s is the birthday of %s\n", bday, name)
} else {
```
- This checks whether the entered name exists in the `birthdays` map. The `ok` is a boolean that indicates whether the name was found in the map.
- If the name exists in the map (`ok == true`), it retrieves the associated birthday (`bday`), and prints the result: `"Alice's birthday is Apr 1"`, for example.
- If the name does not exist in the map (`ok == false`), the program proceeds to the `else` block.

### 6. **Adding a New Birthday**
```go
fmt.Printf("I do not have birthday information for %s\n", name)
fmt.Print("What is their birthday?\n")
scanner.Scan()
bday := scanner.Text()
birthdays[name] = bday
fmt.Println("Birthday database updated.")
```
- If the name was not found in the `birthdays` map, the program prints that it doesn't have birthday information for the given name.
- The user is then prompted to enter the birthday for that person: `"What is their birthday?"`.
- `scanner.Scan()` reads the input, and `bday := scanner.Text()` stores the birthday input.
- The map `birthdays` is then updated with the new name and birthday: `birthdays[name] = bday`.
- The program prints `"Birthday database updated."` to confirm that the new data has been saved.

### 7. **Loop Continues**
- After adding the new birthday or printing the existing one, the program loops again, prompting the user for another name.

### 8. **Exit Condition**
- If the user enters a blank name, the loop breaks and the program ends.

### Example Run:

1. User is asked to enter a name.
   - User enters "Alice" -> program prints "Apr 1 is the birthday of Alice".
2. User is asked to enter a name.
   - User enters "Tom" -> program prints "I do not have birthday information for Tom".
   - User is asked for Tom's birthday, and the user enters "May 15".
   - Program adds "Tom" and "May 15" to the `birthdays` map and prints `"Birthday database updated."`.
3. The loop continues until the user enters a blank name.

### Summary:
- This program maintains a birthday database using a Go `map`.
- The program continuously prompts the user to enter names. If the name exists in the database, it prints the birthday. If not, it asks for the birthday and adds the entry to the database.
- The program will keep running until the user enters a blank name to quit.
