This Go program demonstrates several types of `for` loops and their different behaviors. Let's break down the program step by step to understand the rules and how they work:

### 1. **Simple `for` loop**:
```go
fmt.Println("simple for-loop")
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    fmt.Print(i, " ")
}
fmt.Println()
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `for` loop is used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times.
  - The loop starts with `i := 0` (initialization), and it continues as long as the condition `i < 10` is true.
  - After each iteration, the `i++` part increments the value of `i` by 1.
  - Inside the loop, `fmt.Print(i, " ")` prints the current value of `i` followed by a space.
- **Output**:
  ```
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
  ```

### 2. **Nested loops**:
```go
fmt.Println("nested-loop")
for i := 0; i < 2; i++ {
    //outer loop
    fmt.Println("outer loop:", i)
    for j := 0; j < 3; j++ {
        // inner loop
        fmt.Println("\tinner loop:", j)
    }
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This demonstrates a **nested loop**, where one loop is inside another.
  - The outer loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < 2`, and inside it, the inner loop runs from `j = 0` to `j < 3`.
  - For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop executes completely.
  - `fmt.Println("outer loop:", i)` prints the current value of `i`, and for each value of `i`, the inner loop prints the current value of `j`.
- **Output**:
  ```
  outer loop: 0
      inner loop: 0
      inner loop: 1
      inner loop: 2
  outer loop: 1
      inner loop: 0
      inner loop: 1
      inner loop: 2
  ```

### 3. **`for` loop like C's `while` loop**:
```go
fmt.Println("like C while")
var x = 0
for x < 10 {
    fmt.Print(x, " ")
    x++
}
fmt.Println()
```
- **Explanation**:
  - In Go, there is no direct `while` keyword like in C, but you can achieve the same effect with the `for` loop.
  - The condition `x < 10` is checked at the beginning of each iteration.
  - The loop continues as long as the condition is true, and `x++` increments `x` by 1 in each iteration.
  - `fmt.Print(x, " ")` prints the value of `x` followed by a space.
- **Output**:
  ```
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 
  ```

### 4. **`for` loop with `break`**:
```go
fmt.Println("for with break")
x = 0
for x < 10 {
    if x == 5 {
        break // break will kick you out of loop
    }
    fmt.Print(x, " ")
    x++
}
fmt.Println()
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `break` statement is used to exit the loop prematurely.
  - In this case, when `x == 5`, the `break` statement is executed, causing the loop to stop even if the condition `x < 10` is still true.
  - Before reaching `x == 5`, the program prints the value of `x` and increments it.
- **Output**:
  ```
  0 1 2 3 4 
  ```
  - The loop stops when `x == 5`, so it doesn't print any value after 4.

### 5. **`for` loop with `continue`**:
```go
fmt.Println("for with continue")
x = 0
for x < 10 {
    x++
    if x%2 == 0 {
        continue // continue will skip the rest of the current iteration and go to the next one
    }
    fmt.Print(x, " ")
}
fmt.Println()
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.
  - In this case, `x++` increments `x` by 1 in each iteration, and if `x` is even (`x%2 == 0`), the `continue` statement is executed, skipping the `fmt.Print(x, " ")` and proceeding to the next iteration.
  - As a result, only odd values of `x` are printed because even values are skipped.
- **Output**:
  ```
  1 3 5 7 9 
  ```
  - The loop prints only the odd numbers from `1` to `9` because the `continue` statement skips the even ones.

### Summary:
- **`for` loop**: The most basic loop in Go, which can be used for both **finite iteration** (with conditions) and **infinite iteration** (when the condition is omitted).
- **Nested loop**: A loop inside another loop, useful for handling multidimensional data or more complex conditions.
- **`for` like `while`**: Go doesn't have a `while` loop, but you can replicate it with a `for` loop that only has a condition (no initialization or increment).
- **`break`**: Exits the loop immediately, regardless of whether the condition is true or false.
- **`continue`**: Skips the remaining code in the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.

These are all examples of how loops can be used to control the flow of execution in Go programs, and they demonstrate common loop control structures: **iteration**, **nested loops**, **early exit (`break`)**, and **skipping iterations (`continue`)**.
