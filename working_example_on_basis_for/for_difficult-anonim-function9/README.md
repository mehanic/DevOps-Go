Let's break down the Go code provided and explain how it works:

### Overall Objective:
The program is designed to remove duplicate elements from a slice of integers. It uses a custom `Set` function to filter out duplicates, and the `removeDuplicates` function will return the length of the slice after duplicates have been removed.

### Code Explanation:

#### 1. `Set` function:
```go
func Set(x_slice ...int) []int {
    var arr []int = []int{}
    // fmt.Printf("%T %#v\n",x_slice,x_slice)
    for i, el := range x_slice {
        // fmt.Printf("%d   =>>>><<<<=   %t\n",el,include(x_slice,el))
        if include(x_slice[i:], el) {
            arr = append(arr, el)
        }
    }
    return arr
}
```
- **Parameters**:
  - The `Set` function takes a variable-length argument (`x_slice ...int`). This means it can accept any number of integers.
  
- **Logic**:
  - `arr` is an empty slice that will hold the filtered integers (with duplicates removed).
  - The `for i, el := range x_slice` loop iterates over the elements of `x_slice` starting at the current index `i` and checking if the current element `el` should be added to the result slice `arr`.
  - The function calls `include(x_slice[i:], el)` for each element. The purpose of this is to check if the element `el` exists more than once in the remaining portion of the slice. 
  - If `el` occurs only once (in the remaining part of the slice), it's added to `arr`.

#### 2. `include` function:
```go
func include(nums []int, n int) bool {
    count := 0
    for _, el := range nums {
        if el == n {
            count++
        }
    }
    if count < 2 {
        return true
    }
    return false
}
```
- **Parameters**:
  - `nums []int`: A slice of integers.
  - `n int`: A specific integer to check for duplicates.
  
- **Logic**:
  - The `count` variable counts how many times the integer `n` appears in the `nums` slice.
  - If the integer `n` appears only once or not at all (`count < 2`), the function returns `true` (indicating that `n` should be included in the final result).
  - If `n` appears more than once in the `nums` slice, it returns `false` (indicating that `n` should not be included).

#### 3. `removeDuplicates` function:
```go
func removeDuplicates(nums []int) int {
    nums = append(nums[:0], Set(nums...)...)
    k := len(nums)
    fmt.Println("nums", nums)
    return k
}
```
- **Parameters**:
  - `nums []int`: A slice of integers (which may have duplicates).
  
- **Logic**:
  - First, the `Set(nums...)` function is called. This will return a new slice where all the duplicates have been removed. The result of this call is assigned back to `nums`.
  - The `append(nums[:0], ...)` expression ensures that `nums` is cleared before the new values are appended. This avoids modifying the original slice in place.
  - The length of the updated slice `nums` is stored in `k`, and the slice is printed for verification.
  - Finally, the function returns `k`, which is the length of the new slice without duplicates.

#### 4. `main` function:
```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println(removeDuplicates([]int{1, 1, 2}))
}
```
- The `main` function calls `removeDuplicates` with a test slice `{1, 1, 2}`.
- The result of `removeDuplicates` is printed, which will be the length of the slice after duplicates have been removed.

### Output:
The input slice `{1, 1, 2}` has duplicates (two `1`s). The `removeDuplicates` function will remove the duplicate `1` and return the length of the resulting slice `{1, 2}`, which is `2`.

### Detailed Walkthrough of Execution:
1. **Input**: `{1, 1, 2}`
2. **Step 1**: The `removeDuplicates` function calls `Set(nums...)` with `{1, 1, 2}`.
   - The `Set` function iterates through the slice `{1, 1, 2}`:
     - For the first element (`1`), `include(x_slice[i:], 1)` checks the remaining slice `{1, 2}` and confirms that `1` appears only once, so `1` is added to the result.
     - For the second element (`1`), `include(x_slice[i:], 1)` checks the remaining slice `{2}` and confirms that `1` appears only once in the remaining part, so it is added to the result.
     - For the third element (`2`), `include(x_slice[i:], 2)` checks the remaining slice `{}` and confirms that `2` appears only once in the remaining part, so it is added to the result.
   - The result of `Set(nums...)` is `{1, 2}`.
3. **Step 2**: The length of `{1, 2}` is `2`, and that value is returned.

### Important Notes:
1. **Set Function**: The `Set` function removes duplicates from the slice. However, its approach may not be the most efficient. Specifically, it checks for duplicates by iterating through the rest of the slice (`x_slice[i:]`) for each element, which makes it an O(n^2) algorithm. This could be optimized further.
   
2. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) because a new slice is created to hold the unique values.

### Alternative Optimizations:
1. **Hashing**: Instead of checking for duplicates by iterating over the slice, you can use a map (hash map) to track already seen elements. This would reduce the time complexity to O(n) instead of O(n^2).
