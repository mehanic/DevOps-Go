This Go program demonstrates the conversion of integer values to characters using their corresponding Unicode (or ASCII) code points and their byte representations.

### Breakdown of the Code:

```go
for i := 50; i <= 140; i++ {
    fmt.Printf("%v - %v - %v \n", i, string(i), []byte(string(i)))
}
```

#### 1. **Looping through Integer Values**

The `for` loop iterates through the integer values from `50` to `140` (inclusive). For each value `i` in this range, the program performs the following operations:

- **`fmt.Printf("%v - %v - %v \n", i, string(i), []byte(string(i)))`**:
  - `i`: The loop variable `i` represents an integer value, which is a Unicode code point in this case.
  - `string(i)`: This converts the integer `i` into the corresponding Unicode character. The `string(i)` expression converts the integer into a character using its Unicode code point.
  - `[]byte(string(i))`: This converts the character (created by `string(i)`) into a byte slice (`[]byte`). The byte slice represents the character in its raw byte form.

#### 2. **Formatting with `fmt.Printf`**

- **`%v`**: The `%v` format verb is used to print the default format of the value. In this case:
  - The first `%v` prints the integer value `i`.
  - The second `%v` prints the string representation of that integer (the corresponding character).
  - The third `%v` prints the byte slice representation of the character.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's go through a few iterations of the loop for better understanding:

#### Iteration 1 (`i = 50`):
- `i`: The value of `i` is `50`.
- `string(i)`: The Unicode character corresponding to `50` is `'2'` (the digit `2` in ASCII).
- `[]byte(string(i))`: The byte slice for the character `'2'` is `[50]` because the ASCII value of the character `'2'` is `50`.

Output for `i = 50`:
```
50 - 2 - [50]
```

#### Iteration 2 (`i = 51`):
- `i`: The value of `i` is `51`.
- `string(i)`: The Unicode character corresponding to `51` is `'3'` (the digit `3` in ASCII).
- `[]byte(string(i))`: The byte slice for the character `'3'` is `[51]` because the ASCII value of the character `'3'` is `51`.

Output for `i = 51`:
```
51 - 3 - [51]
```

#### Iteration 3 (`i = 52`):
- `i`: The value of `i` is `52`.
- `string(i)`: The Unicode character corresponding to `52` is `'4'` (the digit `4` in ASCII).
- `[]byte(string(i))`: The byte slice for the character `'4'` is `[52]` because the ASCII value of the character `'4'` is `52`.

Output for `i = 52`:
```
52 - 4 - [52]
```

#### Iteration 10 (`i = 59`):
- `i`: The value of `i` is `59`.
- `string(i)`: The Unicode character corresponding to `59` is `';'` (the semicolon).
- `[]byte(string(i))`: The byte slice for the character `';'` is `[59]`.

Output for `i = 59`:
```
59 - ; - [59]
```

### Output:
The program will print a series of lines showing the integer value `i`, the corresponding character for that value, and the byte slice representation of that character, like this:

```
50 - 2 - [50]
51 - 3 - [51]
52 - 4 - [52]
53 - 5 - [53]
54 - 6 - [54]
55 - 7 - [55]
56 - 8 - [56]
57 - 9 - [57]
58 - : - [58]
59 - ; - [59]
...
140 -  - [140]
```

### Summary of Key Concepts:

1. **Unicode Code Points**: Each integer in the loop corresponds to a Unicode code point, and calling `string(i)` converts the integer into the corresponding character.

2. **Byte Representation**: Characters in Go are stored as sequences of bytes. When you call `[]byte(string(i))`, it gives you the byte representation of the character corresponding to `i`.

3. **The Range 50 to 140**: This loop iterates through integers from `50` to `140`. In this range:
   - From 50 to 57, you get the digits `2` through `9`.
   - From 58 to 64, you get some punctuation marks (e.g., `;`, `<`, `=`, `>`).
   - From 65 to 90, you get the uppercase alphabet letters (`A` to `Z`).
   - From 91 to 96, you get some more punctuation marks (`[`, `\`, `]`, `^`, `_`, `` ` ``).
   - From 97 to 122, you get the lowercase alphabet letters (`a` to `z`).
   - And so on for higher code points.

### Conclusion:
This Go program loops through integers and demonstrates how to convert them into their corresponding characters and their byte representations. It helps to understand how characters are stored and represented in memory, particularly in the context of their Unicode or ASCII values.
