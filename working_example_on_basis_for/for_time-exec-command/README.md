Let's break down the code you've provided and explain how it works step by step:

### Code Explanation:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os/exec"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	// 1. Set up the initial countdown value.
	timeLeft := 10

	// 2. Start a countdown loop.
	for timeLeft > 0 {
		// 3. Print the current value of timeLeft (the countdown number).
		fmt.Print(timeLeft)

		// 4. Wait for 1 second before continuing the countdown.
		time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)

		// 5. Decrement the timeLeft counter by 1.
		timeLeft--
	}

	// 6. Once the countdown ends, play a sound file.
	err := exec.Command("cmd", "/c", "start", "alarm.wav").Run()

	// 7. If there's an error playing the sound, print an error message.
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error playing sound:", err)
	}
}
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Variable Initialization:**
   ```go
   timeLeft := 10
   ```
   - This initializes a variable `timeLeft` and sets it to 10, which will be the starting point for the countdown.
   
2. **Countdown Loop:**
   ```go
   for timeLeft > 0 {
       fmt.Print(timeLeft)
       time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
       timeLeft--
   }
   ```
   - A `for` loop is used to run the countdown. The loop will continue to run as long as `timeLeft` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `fmt.Print(timeLeft)`: This prints the current value of `timeLeft` (the number in the countdown) to the console.
     - `time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)`: This causes the program to wait (sleep) for 1 second before continuing to the next iteration.
     - `timeLeft--`: This decreases `timeLeft` by 1 after each loop iteration.

3. **Play Sound When Countdown Reaches Zero:**
   ```go
   err := exec.Command("cmd", "/c", "start", "alarm.wav").Run()
   ```
   - After the countdown finishes (i.e., `timeLeft` reaches 0), the program runs the `exec.Command()` function.
   - This is used to run an external command to play a sound file.
   - The command `"cmd", "/c", "start", "alarm.wav"` will launch the Windows command prompt (`cmd`) and use the `start` command to play a file named `alarm.wav`.
     - `cmd`: Command prompt on Windows.
     - `/c`: Tells `cmd` to execute the command that follows and then terminate.
     - `start`: A command to launch a program or open a file.
     - `alarm.wav`: The name of the sound file to play (make sure this file exists in the directory or provide the correct path to it).
   - The `Run()` method is used to execute this command.

4. **Error Handling:**
   ```go
   if err != nil {
       fmt.Println("Error playing sound:", err)
   }
   ```
   - After attempting to run the command, the program checks if any error occurred (`err != nil`).
   - If an error did occur (for example, if the sound file was not found or there was an issue with the `cmd` command), the error is printed out using `fmt.Println()`, and the message "Error playing sound" is displayed along with the error details.

### Summary of Key Concepts:

1. **Countdown Logic:**
   - The program counts down from 10 to 1, printing each number every second.
   - The countdown is done in the loop, with the `time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)` causing the program to wait 1 second between each countdown.

2. **Executing External Command:**
   - The `exec.Command()` function is used to run the Windows command prompt (`cmd`) to start a file (in this case, a sound file `alarm.wav`).
   - This allows the program to interact with external resources like sound files and launch programs.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - The program checks if the command to play the sound was successful. If not, it handles the error and provides feedback.

### Key Points:
- The program uses **time.sleep()** to create a delay in the countdown, and the countdown is printed every second.
- When the countdown reaches zero, it attempts to play a sound file (`alarm.wav`), and if there's an issue with playing the sound, it prints an error message.
- The program assumes that it is running on a Windows system, where the `cmd` command and the `start` command are available for launching the sound file.
