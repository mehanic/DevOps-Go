This Go program is designed to **print all numbers in a given range**, starting from a `start` value and ending at an `end` value (both inclusive).

---

## âœ… **Step-by-step explanation**

### 1. **Variable Declaration**
```go
var start, end int
```
- Two integer variables `start` and `end` are declared.
- These variables will store the user's input for the starting and ending numbers of the range.

---

### 2. **Input Handling**
```go
fmt.Scan(&start)
fmt.Scan(&end)
```
- The `fmt.Scan()` function is used to read input from the user.
- It expects the user to **input two integers**, one for `start` and one for `end`.
- The values are stored in the `start` and `end` variables.

---

### 3. **For Loop to Print the Range**
```go
for i := start; i <= end; i++ {
	fmt.Println(i)
}
```
- The **`for` loop** starts from the value of `start` and increments `i` by 1 each time (`i++`).
- The loop continues until `i` reaches `end`.
- The `fmt.Println(i)` function prints each value of `i` on a new line.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Example Input and Output**

```
Input:
5 10

Output:
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

## âœ… **Summary of Rules**
1. Declare two integer variables: `start` and `end`.
2. Use `fmt.Scan()` to take input from the user.
3. Use a `for` loop to iterate from `start` to `end`.
4. Print each number within the range.
