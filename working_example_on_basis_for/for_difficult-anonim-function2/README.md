Let's break down the Go code step by step and explain the logic:

### Code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main(){
	var arr = []int{1, 4, 8, 9, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4}
	var average_value int 
	for _, el := range arr {
		average_value += el
	}
	average_value = average_value / len(arr)
	fmt.Println("O'rtacha qiymat :=", average_value)
}
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initialization of Variables**:
   ```go
   var arr = []int{1, 4, 8, 9, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4}
   var average_value int 
   ```
   - `arr`: This is an array (or more specifically, a slice) that contains a series of integer values: `{1, 4, 8, 9, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4}`.
   - `average_value`: This is a variable of type `int` that will store the sum of all the values in the array during the loop. Initially, it is set to `0` by default in Go (since it's declared but not explicitly initialized).

2. **Summing the Elements of the Array**:
   ```go
   for _, el := range arr {
       average_value += el
   }
   ```
   - The `for` loop is used here to iterate over the slice `arr`.
   - `_, el := range arr`: This `range` loop iterates over each element in the slice `arr`. `el` represents the current element of the array in each iteration, and `_` is used as a placeholder for the index, which is not needed in this case.
   - `average_value += el`: This adds the value of each element `el` to the `average_value` variable. So, after the loop, `average_value` will hold the sum of all the numbers in the array.

   Let's see how `average_value` changes during the loop:

   - Initially, `average_value = 0`.
   - In the first iteration, `el = 1`, so `average_value += 1` → `average_value = 1`.
   - In the second iteration, `el = 4`, so `average_value += 4` → `average_value = 5`.
   - In the third iteration, `el = 8`, so `average_value += 8` → `average_value = 13`.
   - In the fourth iteration, `el = 9`, so `average_value += 9` → `average_value = 22`.
   - In the fifth iteration, `el = 1`, so `average_value += 1` → `average_value = 23`.
   - In the sixth iteration, `el = 1`, so `average_value += 1` → `average_value = 24`.
   - In the seventh iteration, `el = 2`, so `average_value += 2` → `average_value = 26`.
   - In the eighth iteration, `el = 3`, so `average_value += 3` → `average_value = 29`.
   - In the ninth iteration, `el = 4`, so `average_value += 4` → `average_value = 33`.

   After the loop, `average_value` contains the sum of all the elements in the array, which is `33`.

3. **Calculating the Average**:
   ```go
   average_value = average_value / len(arr)
   ```
   - Now, the program calculates the average of the elements by dividing the `average_value` (which is the sum of the elements) by the length of the array `arr`.
   - `len(arr)` returns the number of elements in the array `arr`, which is `9` in this case.
   - So, `average_value = 33 / 9 = 3` (integer division in Go discards the decimal part).

4. **Printing the Result**:
   ```go
   fmt.Println("O'rtacha qiymat :=", average_value)
   ```
   - Finally, the program prints the result, which is the calculated average value. The output will be: `O'rtacha qiymat := 3`.

### Output:

```
O'rtacha qiymat := 3
```

### Explanation of Key Concepts:

1. **`for` loop**: This is a range-based `for` loop that iterates over each element of the slice `arr`. The `range` keyword returns two values: the index and the value of each element, but in this case, only the value (`el`) is used.
   
2. **Sum Calculation**: The `average_value` is updated during each iteration by adding the current element (`el`) to it. After the loop, `average_value` holds the sum of all elements.

3. **Finding the Average**: The average is computed by dividing the sum of the elements by the number of elements in the array (`len(arr)`). The division is done using integer division (since `average_value` is an integer), so the result is truncated to an integer.

4. **Integer Division**: In Go, when both operands are integers, the division results in integer division, which truncates the decimal part. For example, `33 / 9 = 3`.

### Summary:

- The program calculates the sum of all the elements in the array `arr`.
- Then, it divides the sum by the length of the array to calculate the average value.
- The average value is printed out, which in this case is `3`.
