This Go code demonstrates **best practices for naming errors** in Go, and follows conventions around error handling and naming. Let's break down the rules and concepts shown in the code.

### **1. Naming Conventions for Sentinel Errors**

A **sentinel error** is a predefined error value that is typically used to represent common error conditions, like "not found" or "invalid argument". 

- **Prefixing with `err` or `Err`**:
  - **Non-exported errors** (internal to the package) start with `err` in lowercase (e.g., `errNotFound`).
  - **Exported errors** (accessible from other packages) start with `Err` in uppercase (e.g., `ErrNotFound`).

**Example:**
```go
var (
    errNotFound = errors.New("error not found") // Not exported
    ErrNotFound = errors.New("error not found") // Exported
)
```
- **`errNotFound`** is not exported and is intended for internal use within the package. 
- **`ErrNotFound`** is exported and can be used outside the package. 
- Both represent the same concept (an error when something is not found), but **exported** errors allow other packages to access and check them.

### **2. Custom Error Types**

In Go, you can define custom error types by creating a struct that implements the `error` interface. The custom error type typically ends with `Error` to signal itâ€™s an error type.

- **Error types that end with `Error`**: This is a convention used in Go to indicate that the type represents an error.
  - This is a common Go idiom to indicate custom error types.

**Example:**
```go
type NotFoundError struct {
    page string
}

func (e *NotFoundError) Error() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("page %q not found", e.page)
}
```
- **`NotFoundError`** is a custom error type that holds additional information (a URL or page) and implements the `Error()` method to conform to the `error` interface. 

- The **`Error()`** method defines how the error is represented when converted to a string. In this case, it returns a formatted string that indicates which page is not found.

### **3. Exported vs. Non-Exported Custom Errors**

Just like sentinel errors, **custom error types** can also be exported or not based on whether they are meant to be accessed outside the package.

**Example:**
```go
var (
    errNotFound2 = &NotFoundError{"https://www.golang-courses.ru/"} // Not exported
    ErrNotFound2 = &NotFoundError{"https://www.golang-courses.ru/"} // Exported
)
```
- **`errNotFound2`** is a **non-exported** custom error value, so it is only usable within the `naming` package.
- **`ErrNotFound2`** is **exported** and can be used outside the `naming` package.
- Both are instances of the `NotFoundError` type, but only `ErrNotFound2` can be accessed from other packages.

### **4. The `nolint` Directive**

The `nolint` directive is used to disable specific linters on the code, which helps silence warnings about unused variables, dead code, or other issues that might be flagged by linters.

In this case, the directive:
```go
// nolint:deadcode,unused,varcheck
```
- **`deadcode`**: Disables warnings about unused or unreachable code.
- **`unused`**: Disables warnings for unused variables or imports.
- **`varcheck`**: Disables warnings related to unused or undefined variables.
This is often used to temporarily disable certain linter checks, particularly when you intentionally leave some code in place (like error variables) that may not be used directly but are part of the public API or for future use.

### **Summary of the Rules**:

1. **Sentinel errors** should use:
   - **`err` (lowercase)** for non-exported errors.
   - **`Err` (uppercase)** for exported errors.
   
2. **Custom error types** should:
   - Have names that end in `Error` (e.g., `NotFoundError`), as a convention to indicate they represent errors.
   - Implement the `Error()` method to return a string that describes the error.

3. **Exported vs. non-exported errors**:
   - **Non-exported errors** (e.g., `errNotFound`) are for internal package use.
   - **Exported errors** (e.g., `ErrNotFound`) can be used by other packages.

4. **`nolint` directive** can be used to disable specific linter checks temporarily, especially when intentional unused code or variables exist (e.g., for future use or public API).
