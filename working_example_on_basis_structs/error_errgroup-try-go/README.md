This Go program demonstrates the usage of `errgroup.Group` with the `SetLimit()` and `TryGo()` methods from the `golang.org/x/sync/errgroup` package, focusing on controlling concurrency and error handling with goroutines.

### Key Concepts and Rules:

1. **`errgroup.Group` and `SetLimit()`**:
   - The `errgroup.Group` is used to manage concurrent tasks (goroutines) and errors. 
   - `SetLimit()` allows you to limit the number of concurrent goroutines that can run at the same time. In this case, `eg.SetLimit(1)` means that only **one goroutine** can run concurrently at a time.
   
2. **`TryGo()` Method**:
   - `TryGo()` is a method of the `errgroup.Group` that starts a new goroutine. Unlike `Go()`, which starts a goroutine unconditionally, `TryGo()` returns a boolean indicating whether the goroutine was started:
     - It returns `true` if the goroutine was started.
     - It returns `false` if the goroutine could not be started due to the concurrency limit (which is controlled by `SetLimit()`).
   - This method is useful when you want to check if starting the goroutine is possible based on the current concurrency limit.

3. **Channels and Synchronization**:
   - A `ready` channel is used to synchronize the main goroutine with the one launched by the `eg.Go()` method. The `defer close(ready)` ensures that the channel is closed when the goroutine completes, signaling that the goroutine has finished its task.
   - The `<-ready` line in the main function waits for the channel to be closed, ensuring the main goroutine does not proceed before the first goroutine completes its task.

4. **Concurrency Flow**:
   - `eg.SetLimit(1)` ensures that at most **one goroutine** is running at any given moment.
   - `eg.Go(func() error {...})` starts the first goroutine, which takes 3 seconds to complete (`time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)`).
   - The main goroutine immediately tries to start two more goroutines using `eg.TryGo(f)`. However, since the concurrency limit is set to 1, only the **first call to `TryGo(f)`** will succeed. The second call will return `false` because the concurrency limit is already reached.
   - Once the first goroutine finishes (after sleeping for 3 seconds), the `ready` channel is closed, signaling that the main goroutine can now proceed and the third `TryGo(f)` will succeed.

### Explanation of the Code:

```go
var eg errgroup.Group
eg.SetLimit(1)
```
- `eg.SetLimit(1)` sets the limit on the number of concurrently running goroutines to 1. This means that only **one goroutine** can run at any time, and the others will be deferred until one completes.

```go
ready := make(chan struct{})
eg.Go(func() error {
	defer close(ready)
	time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)
	return nil
})
```
- This starts the first goroutine that sleeps for 3 seconds. The `ready` channel is used to signal the main function when the goroutine has completed.

```go
f := func() error {
	log.Println("SUCCESS")
	return nil
}
```
- The function `f` is a simple function that logs "SUCCESS" and returns `nil`. This function will be used for the goroutines launched via `TryGo()`.

```go
log.Println(eg.TryGo(f))
log.Println(eg.TryGo(f))
```
- The first call to `eg.TryGo(f)` tries to start the goroutine with function `f`. Since the limit is 1 (due to `SetLimit(1)`), this call will **succeed**, and the function will log `"SUCCESS"` after 3 seconds.
- The second call to `eg.TryGo(f)` will return `false` because the concurrency limit has already been reached. No new goroutine can start until one finishes.

```go
<-ready
log.Println(eg.TryGo(f))
```
- The `<-ready` line waits for the first goroutine (which has a `time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)`) to finish. Once this happens, the `ready` channel is closed, and the main goroutine can proceed.
- After waiting for the first goroutine to finish, the third call to `TryGo(f)` will succeed, starting another goroutine that logs `"SUCCESS"`.

```go
_ = eg.Wait()
```
- Finally, `eg.Wait()` blocks until all goroutines have completed. Since we are not handling any errors in this example, the return value of `Wait()` is ignored.

### Output:

The output of the program will be:

```
2023/06/04 12:19:57 false
2023/06/04 12:19:57 false
2023/06/04 12:20:00 true
2023/06/04 12:20:00 SUCCESS
```

**Explanation of the Output**:

1. `2023/06/04 12:19:57 false`:
   - The first `TryGo(f)` call returns `false` because the first goroutine is still running, and the concurrency limit is set to 1.

2. `2023/06/04 12:19:57 false`:
   - The second `TryGo(f)` call also returns `false` for the same reason. No goroutine can be started while the first one is running.

3. `2023/06/04 12:20:00 true`:
   - After the first goroutine completes (after 3 seconds), the third call to `TryGo(f)` returns `true` because the concurrency limit is no longer in effect. This starts the third goroutine.

4. `2023/06/04 12:20:00 SUCCESS`:
   - The third goroutine logs `"SUCCESS"` after being started by the third call to `TryGo(f)`.

### Conclusion:

- **`SetLimit(1)`** ensures that only one goroutine can run at a time. 
- **`TryGo()`** is useful when you want to check whether a goroutine can be started based on the current concurrency limit.
- The output demonstrates that only one goroutine can run concurrently, and subsequent calls to `TryGo()` return `false` until the first goroutine finishes. After that, new goroutines can be started again.
