This Go program defines a `champion` struct to represent champions, such as characters in a game, and demonstrates how to create, store, and manipulate a collection of them. Let's break down the code and explain the rules and key concepts:

### **1. Defining the `champion` Struct:**

```go
type champion struct {
	Name    string   `json:"name"`
	Classes []string `json:"classes"`
	Origins []string `json:"origins"`
	Cost    int      `json:"cost"`
}
```

- The `champion` struct is a custom data type representing a champion.
- The fields are:
  - **Name**: A string representing the name of the champion.
  - **Classes**: A slice of strings representing the classes the champion belongs to (e.g., "Assassin", "Shapeshifter").
  - **Origins**: A slice of strings representing the origins the champion comes from (e.g., "Ninja", "Demon").
  - **Cost**: An integer representing the cost of the champion.

The struct tags like `json:"name"` are used for JSON serialization/deserialization, but they are not used in this program directly.

### **2. The `createChampions` Function:**

```go
func createChampions() (champion, champion, champion, champion, champion) {
	// champion definitions
}
```

- The `createChampions` function returns five instances of the `champion` struct.
- Inside the function, five `champion` instances (`akali`, `ev`, `kat`, `elise`, and `gnar`) are created, each initialized with specific values for `Name`, `Classes`, `Origins`, and `Cost`.
- These champions are returned as a tuple (multiple values).

### **3. Creating and Assigning to Arrays:**

```go
champs := [3]champion{}
champs[0] = akali
champs[1] = ev
champs[2] = kat
```

- The `champs` array is a fixed-size array that can hold **exactly 3** `champion` values. 
  - In Go, arrays have a fixed size, and the size must be known at compile-time.
  - You assign specific champions (`akali`, `ev`, `kat`) to the first three slots of the array. 
  - If you attempt to assign to `champs[3]`, it will result in a **compile-time error** because the array only has 3 elements.

```go
log.Printf("There are %d champs, %v\n\n", len(champs), champs)
```

- The `len(champs)` function gives the length of the array (3 in this case).
- `champs` is printed out, showing the contents of the array.

### **4. Working with Slices (Dynamic Arrays):**

Slices are more flexible than arrays because they can grow and shrink dynamically.

#### **Creating an Empty Slice:**

```go
assassins := []champion{}
log.Printf("assassins length=%d, capacity=%d\n\n", len(assassins), cap(assassins))
```

- `assassins` is initialized as an **empty slice**.
- `len(assassins)` gives the number of elements in the slice (0 at first), and `cap(assassins)` gives the **capacity** (the maximum number of elements the slice can hold without needing to reallocate). Initially, its capacity is 0 because it’s an empty slice.

#### **Appending to a Slice:**

```go
assassins = append(assassins, akali, ev, kat)
log.Printf("assassins length=%d, capacity=%d, contents=%v\n\n", len(assassins), cap(assassins), assassins)
```

- The `append()` function is used to add elements (`akali`, `ev`, `kat`) to the `assassins` slice.
- After appending, the slice grows dynamically to accommodate the new champions. The **capacity** might also increase depending on the number of elements added.
- The new length and capacity are printed.

#### **Creating and Appending to Another Slice:**

```go
shapeshifters := []champion{elise, gnar}
log.Printf("shapeshifters length=%d, capacity=%d, contents=%v\n\n", len(shapeshifters), cap(shapeshifters), shapeshifters)
```

- The `shapeshifters` slice is initialized with two elements (`elise` and `gnar`).
- The `len()` and `cap()` functions are used to print the length and capacity of the `shapeshifters` slice.

#### **Combining Two Slices:**

```go
allChamps := []champion{}
allChamps = append(allChamps, assassins...)
allChamps = append(allChamps, shapeshifters...)
log.Printf("allChamps length=%d, capacity=%d, contents=%v\n\n", len(allChamps), cap(allChamps), allChamps)
```

- `allChamps` is an initially empty slice.
- The `append()` function is used to add all elements of `assassins` and `shapeshifters` to `allChamps`.
  - `assassins...` and `shapeshifters...` use the **variadic syntax** to unpack the slices and append their elements.
- The resulting `allChamps` slice contains the combined champions from both the `assassins` and `shapeshifters` slices.
- After appending, the new length and capacity are printed.

### **5. Important Concepts:**

#### **Arrays:**
- Arrays in Go have a **fixed size**. Once you define the size, you cannot change it.
- In the example, the array `champs` can only hold 3 `champion` elements. Attempting to add more (like `champs[3] = elise`) would result in a compilation error.

#### **Slices:**
- Slices are **dynamically-sized** and can grow or shrink during runtime.
- `append()` is used to add elements to slices. Slices can expand their capacity as needed when new elements are added.
- The **capacity** of a slice is the maximum number of elements the slice can hold before it needs to reallocate memory.

#### **The `...` Operator:**
- The `...` operator unpacks the slice into individual elements when passed to functions like `append()`. This allows you to append multiple elements at once from another slice.

### **6. Summary of Output:**

- **Initial Array (`champs`)**: Prints out the array of 3 champions with their details.
- **`assassins` Slice**: Initially empty, its length and capacity are printed before and after appending the first 3 champions.
- **`shapeshifters` Slice**: Contains 2 champions (`elise`, `gnar`), and its length and capacity are printed.
- **`allChamps` Slice**: After appending both the `assassins` and `shapeshifters` slices, it contains all 5 champions, and the resulting length and capacity are printed.

### **Final Notes:**
- **Arrays** are fixed in size, while **slices** are flexible and can grow or shrink during the program’s execution.
- **Slices** are more commonly used in Go for dynamic collections of data because of their flexibility.
