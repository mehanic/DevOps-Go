This Go program reads a file containing the first million digits of Pi (`pi_million_digits.txt`), processes the file to concatenate all lines into a single string, and then prints the first 52 characters of the Pi digits followed by an ellipsis (`...`). It also prints the total length of the concatenated string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

### Code Breakdown:

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strings"
)
```
- **Imports:**
  - `bufio`: Used for buffered I/O operations, specifically `Scanner` here to read the file line by line.
  - `fmt`: Used for formatted I/O, such as printing output to the console.
  - `os`: Used for OS-level tasks like opening and closing files.
  - `strings`: Used for string manipulation tasks, such as trimming and concatenating strings.

---

### Opening the File:
```go
filename := "pi_million_digits.txt"

file, err := os.Open(filename)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
	return
}
defer file.Close()
```
- **`os.Open(filename)`** opens the file `pi_million_digits.txt` for reading.
- If the file can't be opened (e.g., it doesn't exist or there's an I/O error), an error message is printed and the program terminates early (`return`).
- **`defer file.Close()`** ensures that the file will be closed when the `main()` function finishes, no matter how it finishes (even if thereâ€™s an error).

---

### Reading the File:
```go
var piString strings.Builder
scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)
for scanner.Scan() {
	line := scanner.Text()
	piString.WriteString(strings.TrimSpace(line))
}
```
- **`strings.Builder`**: This is a type that efficiently builds a string. It's used here to concatenate the digits of Pi from each line of the file.
- **`bufio.NewScanner(file)`**: Creates a `Scanner` object to read the file line by line.
- **`for scanner.Scan()`**: Loops through each line of the file. `scanner.Text()` returns the current line as a string.
- **`strings.TrimSpace(line)`**: Removes any leading or trailing whitespace characters (like newlines) from each line.
- **`piString.WriteString(...)`**: Appends the cleaned-up line to the `piString` `strings.Builder`.

---

### Error Checking:
```go
if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
	fmt.Println("Error reading file:", err)
	return
}
```
- After reading the file, this checks if there were any errors during the scanning process.
- If an error occurred, it prints an error message and exits the program.

---

### Processing the String:
```go
piStringValue := piString.String()
```
- **`piString.String()`**: Converts the contents of the `strings.Builder` (which contains the concatenated digits of Pi) into a string.

---

### Output:
```go
fmt.Println(piStringValue[:52] + "...")
fmt.Println(len(piStringValue))
```
- **`piStringValue[:52]`**: This slices the first 52 characters of the `piStringValue`.
- **`+ "..."`**: Adds ellipsis to the end of the first 52 characters to indicate that the string continues.
- **`fmt.Println(len(piStringValue))`**: Prints the total length of the concatenated Pi string (the number of characters).

---

### Summary:
1. **File reading**: The program reads the contents of a file containing Pi's digits (`pi_million_digits.txt`), line by line.
2. **Concatenation**: Each line is cleaned (removing leading/trailing spaces) and concatenated into a single string using `strings.Builder`.
3. **Output**: It prints the first 52 characters of Pi followed by an ellipsis, and the total length of the concatenated string (number of digits read).

This program is designed to handle large files efficiently (by using a `strings.Builder` to append data) and to avoid errors while reading files or processing the data.
