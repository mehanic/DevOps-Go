Your Go program demonstrates a **common mistake** when working with file I/O: attempting to write to a **closed file**.  

---

## **üîπ Key Issues in the Code**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Opening and Closing the File**
```go
f, err := os.Open("/etc/hosts")
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
if err := f.Close(); err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```
‚úÖ The file **opens successfully**.  
‚ùå However, **`os.Open` opens the file in read-only mode**, and closing it immediately prevents any future writes.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Writing to a Closed File**
```go
w := bufio.NewWriter(f)
w.WriteString("bad") //nolint:errcheck
```
- `bufio.NewWriter(f)` creates a buffered writer **for the closed file `f`**.
- `w.WriteString("bad")` attempts to **write to the closed file**, but errors are ignored due to `//nolint:errcheck`.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Flushing the Writer**
```go
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    if err := w.Flush(); err != nil {
        fmt.Println(err)
    }
}
```
- `w.Flush()` forces the writer to write its buffered content to the file.
- **Since the file is already closed**, `Flush()` fails repeatedly with:  
  ```
  write /etc/hosts: file already closed
  ```

## **üîπ Summary of Rules**
‚úÖ **1. Always check the file mode (`os.Open` is read-only, use `os.OpenFile` for writing).**  
‚úÖ **2. Don't close a file before using it.**  
‚úÖ **3. Always handle and check for errors properly (`//nolint:errcheck` hides potential bugs).**  
‚úÖ **4. `Flush()` should only be called on an open, writable file.**  

---

## **‚úÖ Corrected Version**
To fix this issue, **open the file with write permissions**, and **only close it after writing**:
```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Open the file for writing (O_RDWR: read & write, O_APPEND: append mode)
	f, err := os.OpenFile("/etc/hosts", os.O_RDWR|os.O_APPEND, 0644)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer f.Close() // Ensure file is closed at the end

	// Create a buffered writer
	w := bufio.NewWriter(f)

	// Write to the file and check for errors
	if _, err := w.WriteString("bad\n"); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Write error:", err)
	}

	// Flush the buffer and check for errors
	if err := w.Flush(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Flush error:", err)
	}
}
```
üöÄ **This version ensures the file is writable, remains open until writing is complete, and handles errors properly!**
