### Code Explanation:

The provided Go code demonstrates handling an error when trying to open a file that does not exist, and how error messages are logged using both `fmt.Println` and the `log` package. Let's break down the rules and key concepts:

#### 1. **Opening a Non-Existent File:**
```go
_, err := os.Open("no-file.txt")
```
- This line attempts to open a file named `no-file.txt` using the `os.Open` function. Since the file doesn't exist (as implied by the rest of the code), `os.Open` will return an error (`err`).
- The `os.Open` function returns two values: a `*os.File` (which is ignored here, as indicated by the `_`), and an error (stored in the `err` variable).

#### 2. **Error Handling:**
```go
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("err happened:", err)
    // err happened: open no-file.txt: no such file or directory
}
```
- The `if err != nil` block checks if the error returned by `os.Open` is not `nil`. If the file doesn't exist, this error will be non-`nil`.
- `fmt.Println("err happened:", err)` prints the error message to the standard output (the console).
- The error message output will be something like:
  ```
  err happened: open no-file.txt: no such file or directory
  ```

#### 3. **Logging the Error Using `log.Println`:**
```go
log.Println("err happened:", err)
```
- The `log.Println` function is used to log the error. The key difference between `fmt.Println` and `log.Println` is that the `log` package adds timestamp information and outputs to `stderr` (standard error), while `fmt.Println` just prints to `stdout`.
- The `log.Println` will print the error message along with the date and time in the following format:
  ```
  2023/06/25 14:24:00 err happened: open no-file.txt: no such file or directory
  ```

#### 4. **Standard Output vs. Standard Error:**
- `fmt.Println` writes the message to the **standard output** (`stdout`), which is typically used for regular program output.
- `log.Println` writes the message to the **standard error** (`stderr`), which is used for error messages and diagnostics. This is useful when you want to distinguish normal program output from error logs.

#### 5. **Redirection Example:**
```bash
go run main.go 2&> /dev/null
```
- The command above demonstrates how to redirect the standard error (`stderr`) to `/dev/null`, effectively discarding any error messages.
- The `2&> /dev/null` syntax is used to redirect `stderr` (file descriptor `2`) to `/dev/null`, which is a special file that discards any input sent to it.
- When this is done, the error message produced by `log.Println` will be discarded, but `fmt.Println` will still output to the console (since it's written to `stdout`).

#### **Key Concepts and Rules:**

1. **Error Handling:**
   - When dealing with file operations, you should always check the returned error (like we do with `err != nil` here). This ensures that you handle any issues (such as a missing file) gracefully.

2. **Logging Errors:**
   - The `log.Println` function is specifically designed for logging, and it adds a timestamp and sends the output to `stderr`, making it suitable for error messages, debugging, or diagnostics.
   - `fmt.Println` should be used for normal output, not for errors.

3. **Error Messages and Time Stamps:**
   - The `log.Println` function will automatically include the current date and time, which is useful for keeping track of when specific errors occurred.
   - `log.Println` is often used in production environments because it provides additional context, such as timestamps and standardized output, which is helpful for logging and debugging.

4. **Redirection of Output:**
   - By using the command `go run main.go 2&> /dev/null`, the standard error (`stderr`) can be redirected to discard error logs while still seeing the normal output (`stdout`).
   - This can be useful in scenarios where you only want to capture normal output and not errors.

### Example Output:
- **Using `fmt.Println`:** The error message is printed to the standard output:
  ```
  err happened: open no-file.txt: no such file or directory
  ```

- **Using `log.Println`:** The error message is printed with a timestamp to the standard error:
  ```
  2023/06/25 14:24:00 err happened: open no-file.txt: no such file or directory
  ```

### Conclusion:

This code demonstrates how to handle file opening errors, differentiate between standard output and error logging, and how to use Go's `log` package for error logging with timestamps. Additionally, it highlights how to manage the output stream, especially when redirecting standard error to suppress error messages in certain scenarios.
