The code you've provided demonstrates how to make an HTTP GET request with error handling, using `context` for managing request cancellation and timeouts, and the `errors` package for wrapping and combining errors. Let's break down the rules and principles in the code to understand how it works.

### 1. **Context and Cancellation**

```go
ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
defer cancel()
```

- **`context.Background()`** creates a root context that doesn’t carry any information or cancellation signals.
- **`context.WithCancel()`** creates a derived context (`ctx`) from the background context that can be canceled using the `cancel()` function.
- **`defer cancel()`** ensures that the `cancel` function is called at the end of the `main` function, which helps in releasing resources associated with the context (e.g., canceling the HTTP request if needed).

Using context helps manage the lifecycle of long-running operations (like HTTP requests) and ensures that they can be canceled if needed, preventing unnecessary work.

### 2. **HTTP Request Creation**

```go
req, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, http.MethodGet, url, nil)
if err != nil {
	return nil, errors.WithMessage(err, "create req")
}
```

- **`http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, ...)`** creates a new HTTP request, associating it with the provided `ctx` context.
  - The `ctx` allows the request to be canceled if needed.
  - **`http.MethodGet`** specifies that this is a GET request.
  - **`url`** is the URL that the request is going to.
  - `nil` indicates that the request has no body.

If an error occurs when creating the request (e.g., invalid URL), it is wrapped in a custom error message using `errors.WithMessage`.

### 3. **Sending the HTTP Request**

```go
response, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
if err != nil {
	return nil, errors.WithMessage(err, "do request")
}
```

- **`http.DefaultClient.Do(req)`** sends the HTTP request and gets a response.
- If an error occurs during the request (e.g., network issues, DNS resolution failure), it is wrapped and returned with the custom message `"do request"`.

### 4. **Defer Closing the Response Body**

```go
defer func() {
	err = errors.CombineErrors(err, response.Body.Close())
}()
```

- **`defer`** ensures that the response body is closed when the function returns.
- **`response.Body.Close()`** is called to release the resources used by the HTTP response body.
- The error returned by `response.Body.Close()` is combined with the primary error (`err`) using `errors.CombineErrors()`. This ensures that if both errors occur (e.g., error from reading the body and error from closing the body), both will be captured and returned together.

Using `CombineErrors()` helps to combine multiple errors into a single one, preserving both.

### 5. **Reading the Response Body**

```go
data, err = ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body)
if err != nil {
	return nil, errors.WithMessage(err, "read body")
}
```

- **`ioutil.ReadAll(response.Body)`** reads the entire response body into the `data` variable.
- If an error occurs while reading the body (e.g., connection reset), it is wrapped with the message `"read body"` and returned.

### 6. **Return the Data and Handle Errors**

```go
return data, nil
```

- If no error occurs, the function returns the `data` (the content of the page) and `nil` for the error.

### **Error Handling Strategy:**
1. **Named Return Values:** The function `GetPage` has **named return values** (`data` and `err`). This allows the function to directly assign values to these variables and return them.
   
   ```go
   func GetPage(ctx context.Context, url string) (data []byte, err error) {
   ```

2. **Using `errors.WithMessage` and `errors.CombineErrors`:**
   - `errors.WithMessage` is used to add context to the error, so when the error is printed or logged, the source of the error is clear (e.g., `"create req"`, `"do request"`, `"read body"`).
   - `errors.CombineErrors` is used to combine multiple errors, ensuring both the error from reading the body and the error from closing the body are captured. Without combining errors, only the first error would be returned, and any secondary error would be lost.

3. **`defer` with Error Handling:** The `defer` statement ensures that `response.Body.Close()` is called even if an error occurs earlier in the function. By using `CombineErrors`, we make sure that if closing the body fails, we don’t lose the original error.

---

### **Main Function**

```go
d, err := GetPage(ctx, google)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Printf("%+v", err)
	return
}
fmt.Println(string(d))
```

- The `main` function calls `GetPage`, passing the `ctx` and `google` URL.
- If there’s an error, the error is printed using `fmt.Printf("%+v", err)`. The `%+v` format specifier will print the full stack trace and context of the error.
- If the function succeeds, it prints the content of the page as a string.

---

### **Summary of Key Concepts:**

1. **Context:** The `context.Context` is used to manage cancellations and deadlines for HTTP requests.
2. **Error Wrapping:** Errors are wrapped with `errors.WithMessage()` to provide more context about where the error occurred.
3. **Error Combining:** Multiple errors can be combined using `errors.CombineErrors()` to ensure all errors are captured.
4. **Defer with Error Handling:** Resources (like the HTTP response body) are closed using `defer`, and errors during this process are handled by combining them with the primary error.

This approach ensures that you have a clear and complete error trace, with all relevant error messages and details, and it ensures proper resource management in a Go application making HTTP requests.
