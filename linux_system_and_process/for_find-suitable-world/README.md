This Go program is designed to **find the most common word across all `.txt` files in the current directory**. Let's break it down step by step:

---

## âœ… **Step-by-step explanation:**

### ðŸŽ¯ 1. **Finding All `.txt` Files in the Current Directory:**
```go
files, _ := filepath.Glob("*.txt")
```
- `filepath.Glob("*.txt")` returns a **list of all `.txt` files** in the current directory.
- The `_` is used to **ignore the error**, but ideally, you should handle errors properly.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ 2. **Create a Map to Track Word Frequency:**
```go
tracker := make(map[string]int)
```
- A **map `tracker`** is created to store **words as keys** and **their frequencies as values**.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ 3. **Iterate Over Each File and Read the Content:**
```go
for _, file := range files {
	content, _ := ioutil.ReadFile(file)
	lines := strings.Split(string(content), "\n")
```
- `ioutil.ReadFile(file)` reads the **file content as a byte slice**.
- `string(content)` converts the content to a string.
- `strings.Split(..., "\n")` splits the content into **lines based on newlines (`\n`)**.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ 4. **Process Each Line to Extract Words:**
```go
for _, line := range lines {
	words := strings.Fields(line)
	for _, word := range words {
		word = strings.ReplaceAll(strings.ReplaceAll(word, ",", ""), ".", "")
		word = strings.ToLower(word)
		tracker[word]++
	}
}
```
- `strings.Fields(line)` splits each line into words (by spaces or tabs).
- `strings.ReplaceAll()` removes **commas and periods** to clean the words.
- `strings.ToLower()` converts each word to **lowercase** to **avoid case sensitivity issues**.
- The word is added to the **`tracker` map**, and its count is incremented.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ 5. **Find the Most Common Word:**
```go
maxKey := ""
maxValue := 0
for key, value := range tracker {
	if value > maxValue {
		maxKey = key
		maxValue = value
	}
}
```
- The loop iterates over the `tracker` map to find the **word with the highest frequency**.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ 6. **Print the Results:**
```go
fmt.Printf("Most common word: %s\n", maxKey)
fmt.Printf("How many times: %d\n", maxValue)
fmt.Printf("Dictionary: %v\n", tracker)
```
- Print the **most common word**, its **count**, and the **full word-frequency dictionary**.

---

## âœ… **Sample Output:**
```
Number of Txt Files: 2
Most common word: hello
How many times: 5
Dictionary: map[hello:5 world:3 go:2 programming:1]
```

## ðŸ”¥ **Key Concepts Explained:**

| Concept              | Explanation                                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `filepath.Glob()`   | Finds all `.txt` files in the current directory. |
| `ioutil.ReadFile()` | Reads the content of each file. |
| `strings.Fields()` | Splits lines into words. |
| `strings.ReplaceAll()` | Removes punctuation like commas and periods. |
| `strings.ToLower()` | Converts words to lowercase for uniformity. |
| `map` in Go             | Tracks the frequency of each word. |
| `for range` loop | Used to find the most common word. |

---

## âœ… **Potential Improvements:**
1. **Handle errors properly**, rather than ignoring them.
2. Filter out **common stop words** like "the", "and", "is", etc.
3. Process different **file encodings** (like UTF-8).
