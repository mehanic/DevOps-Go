The provided Go program demonstrates working with **time** and **date formatting** in Go using the `time` package. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### **1. Importing the `time` package:**
```go
import "time"
```
- The `time` package provides functionality for working with dates and times. It includes functions to get the current time, format time, manipulate dates, and much more.

### **2. Getting the current time in UTC:**
```go
t := time.Now().UTC()
```
- **`time.Now()`** returns the current local time in the system's time zone.
- **`.UTC()`** converts the returned local time into **Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)**.
  - `t` will now hold the current UTC time (i.e., the number of seconds since January 1, 1970, at midnight UTC).

### **3. Converting the time to a string using `t.String()`:**
```go
s1 := t.String()
fmt.Printf("s1: %s\n", s1)
```
- **`t.String()`** converts the time `t` to a string in a default format.
  - The default format is a human-readable string that represents the time and date, like this: `2025-03-15 15:04:05.123456789 +0000 UTC`.
  - It includes the date, time (with nanosecond precision), the UTC offset, and the timezone (in this case, `UTC`).

- **`fmt.Printf("s1: %s\n", s1)`** prints the string `s1`. The `%s` format specifier prints the string in its entirety.

### **4. Formatting the time using `t.Format()`:**
```go
s2 := t.Format("2006-01-02")
fmt.Printf("s2: %s\n", s2)
```
- **`t.Format("2006-01-02")`**:
  - The `Format` function allows you to customize how the date and time are presented.
  - Go uses a specific reference time `2006-01-02 15:04:05`, which corresponds to `Mon Jan 2 15:04:05 MST 2006`. This specific date and time is hardcoded in Go and acts as a template for formatting.
  - The numbers `2006`, `01`, `02`, etc., are the placeholders for **year**, **month**, and **day** respectively. So, when you call `t.Format("2006-01-02")`, you're telling Go to format the current time using just the **year**, **month**, and **day** in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.
  - For example, if the current date is March 15, 2025, it will print `2025-03-15`.

- **`fmt.Printf("s2: %s\n", s2)`** prints the formatted string `s2`. Again, the `%s` format specifier prints the formatted string.

### **Summary of the Output:**
1. **`s1`** will contain the **default string representation** of the UTC time (in full detail including time, nanoseconds, and timezone).
2. **`s2`** will contain the **custom-formatted string** that includes only the **year**, **month**, and **day** in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.

### **Example Output:**
If the current UTC time is `2025-03-15 15:04:05.123456789 +0000 UTC`:
```
s1: 2025-03-15 15:04:05.123456789 +0000 UTC
s2: 2025-03-15
```

### **Key Points:**
- `time.Now().UTC()` gives the current time in UTC.
- `t.String()` gives the default string format for time.
- `t.Format("2006-01-02")` is a custom format that only prints the date in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- The reference time `2006-01-02 15:04:05` in Go's `Format` function is fixed and used as a pattern for date and time formatting.
