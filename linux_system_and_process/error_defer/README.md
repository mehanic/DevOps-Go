This Go code demonstrates the use of basic file operations with functions for **creating**, **writing to**, and **closing** a file, while also using **defer** for ensuring that the file is closed properly. Let's walk through the code and explain its rules and functionality.

### 1. **File Creation (`createFile` function)**
```go
func createFile(filePath string) *os.File {
    fmt.Println("Create file:", filePath)
    file, err := os.Create(filePath)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    return file
}
```
- **`createFile`**: This function is responsible for creating a file at the provided `filePath`.
- `os.Create(filePath)` attempts to create a new file (or truncate an existing file to zero length).
  - If there's an error (e.g., if the directory does not exist, or the program does not have write permission), the function panics with `panic(err)`. In production code, you may want to handle the error gracefully instead of panicking.
- If the file is successfully created, it returns the file object (`*os.File`) for further operations.

### 2. **Writing to the File (`writeFile` function)**
```go
func writeFile(file *os.File, content string) {
    fmt.Println("Write file:", content)
    _, err := file.WriteString(content)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```
- **`writeFile`**: This function is responsible for writing the content string to the file.
- `file.WriteString(content)` writes the string `content` to the file.
  - If an error occurs while writing, it panics (again, you'd likely handle this more carefully in real-world code).
- **`panic(err)`** is called if the write operation fails, which causes the program to terminate and print the error message.

### 3. **Closing the File (`closeFile` function)**
```go
func closeFile(file *os.File) {
    fmt.Println("Close file")
    err := file.Close()
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```
- **`closeFile`**: This function ensures that the file is properly closed after the operations are completed.
- `file.Close()` attempts to close the file.
  - If an error occurs while closing the file (e.g., if the file is already closed or the file system is having issues), it panics.
- The file is closed at the end of the program execution, and **defer** ensures it happens even if an error occurs during writing or any other part of the program.

### 4. **Main Function (`main` function)**
```go
func main() {
    file := createFile("/tmp/defer")
    defer closeFile(file)
    writeFile(file, "file content\n")
}
```
- **`main`**: The entry point of the program, where the following steps happen:
  1. **File creation**: `createFile("/tmp/defer")` creates a file at `/tmp/defer` (or whatever path is provided). This returns the file object, which is stored in the `file` variable.
  2. **Deferring file closure**: `defer closeFile(file)` is used to ensure that the file will be closed when the `main` function completes (even if there's a panic elsewhere).
     - **Defer**: The `defer` statement schedules the `closeFile(file)` function to be executed after the surrounding function (`main`) finishes executing, no matter what (even if there is an error or panic).
     - In this case, when the `main` function finishes, the file will be closed, but **only after all the operations in `main` are completed**.
  3. **Writing to the file**: `writeFile(file, "file content\n")` writes `"file content\n"` to the file.

### 5. **Behavior of `defer`**
- **`defer`** ensures that the `closeFile(file)` function is called after `main` completes, which guarantees the file is always closed.
- **Important rule about `defer`**:
  - **Deferred functions are executed in LIFO (Last In, First Out) order**, meaning the last deferred function will be the first one to execute when the function exits.
  - If the program panics or returns early (due to an error), deferred functions still get executed.

### 6. **File Operations Flow**
1. The program first creates a file at the given path (`/tmp/defer`).
2. Then, it writes the content `"file content\n"` to the file.
3. Even if an error occurs during the file writing, **the file will still be closed**, because the `defer closeFile(file)` guarantees the closing of the file at the end of `main`.
4. After all the operations (including the deferred closing of the file), the program finishes, and the file is safely closed, which frees up resources.

### 7. **Why Use `defer`?**
- Using `defer` ensures that even if an error occurs while writing to the file, the program still attempts to close the file. Without `defer`, you would need to manually close the file at the end of the program, which could lead to resource leaks if you forget to close the file in case of an error.
- It's a way of making resource cleanup more reliable and ensuring that even after an error, cleanup actions (like closing files or releasing locks) are always performed.

### Example Output
If the code runs successfully, the output would be:
```
Create file: /tmp/defer
Write file: file content
Close file
```

If there was an error (e.g., if the file cannot be created or written to), you would see the error message and the program would panic, potentially like this:
```
Create file: /tmp/defer
Write file: file content
panic: norgate math: square root of negative number
```

### Summary of Key Rules:
1. **File Creation**: Use `os.Create()` to create a file.
2. **File Writing**: Use `file.WriteString()` to write content to the file.
3. **File Closing**: Ensure the file is closed by using `defer` to schedule cleanup, even if an error occurs.
4. **`defer` Behavior**: Deferred functions run when the surrounding function (`main` in this case) finishes, regardless of early returns or panics.
5. **Error Handling**: Use `panic(err)` for handling errors in file operations, though you should generally prefer proper error handling in production code.
