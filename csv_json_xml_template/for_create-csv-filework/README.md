This Go code is designed to read and process a CSV file (`my.csv`) by using Go's `encoding/csv` package. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and what each part does:

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Opening the CSV file**:
   ```go
   file, err := os.Open("my.csv")
   if err != nil {
       fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
       return
   }
   defer file.Close()
   ```
   - **`os.Open("my.csv")`**: This line opens the file `my.csv` for reading. If the file doesn't exist or cannot be opened (e.g., due to permission issues), an error is returned.
   - **Error Check**: If there's an error opening the file (`err != nil`), it prints the error message and exits the program (`return`).
   - **`defer file.Close()`**: This ensures that the file is properly closed once the main function completes, even if the function exits early due to an error.

2. **Creating a CSV Reader**:
   ```go
   reader := csv.NewReader(file)
   ```
   - **`csv.NewReader(file)`**: This initializes a new CSV reader that will read from the opened `file`. The CSV reader handles parsing the CSV file format, which may have values separated by commas, tabs, or other delimiters.

3. **Reading and Printing Each Record**:
   ```go
   for {
       record, err := reader.Read()
       if err != nil {
           if err.Error() == "EOF" {
               break
           }
           fmt.Println("Error reading record:", err)
           return
       }
       fmt.Println(record)
   }
   ```
   - **Infinite Loop**: The loop runs indefinitely using `for {}` until a condition is met that will break it.
   - **`record, err := reader.Read()`**: The `Read()` function reads the next record (row) from the CSV file. Each record is returned as a slice of strings (each string represents a cell in that row).
   - **Error Handling**: If there is an error while reading the record, it checks whether the error is `EOF` (end of file).
     - If the error is `EOF`, the loop ends because the end of the file has been reached.
     - If the error is not `EOF`, an error message is printed, and the function exits using `return`.
   - **Printing the Record**: If a record is read successfully, it is printed using `fmt.Println(record)`. This will print the record as a slice of strings (each representing a column in that row of the CSV).

### Key Concepts and Functions:

- **CSV Reading**:
  - `csv.NewReader(file)`: Initializes a CSV reader that takes a file as input. It processes the file and returns records, which are slices of strings, where each string is a cell in that row.
  
- **Error Handling**:
  - **`err != nil`**: This checks if there was an error while trying to open the file or read a record. If an error occurs while opening the file, an error message is printed and the program exits.
  - **EOF Check**: When the CSV reader reaches the end of the file, it returns an error with the message `EOF`. This is used as a signal to stop reading.
  
- **Defer**:
  - **`defer file.Close()`**: This is used to ensure the file gets closed automatically at the end of the function, even if an error occurs or the program exits early.

- **Record Representation**:
  - Each record read by the CSV reader is returned as a slice of strings (`[]string`). Each string in the slice represents a cell (column value) in the CSV file's row.

### Example:
If the content of `my.csv` is:
```
Name, Age, City
John, 30, New York
Jane, 25, Los Angeles
```

The program will output:
```
[Name Age City]
[John 30 New York]
[Jane 25 Los Angeles]
```

### What Happens in the Code:

1. **Open the File**: The program attempts to open the `my.csv` file for reading. If it fails, an error message is displayed, and the program exits.
2. **Initialize the CSV Reader**: A CSV reader is created to parse the file.
3. **Read and Print Records**: The program continuously reads each record from the file and prints it as a slice of strings (each string corresponds to a column in the record). This continues until the end of the file is reached, at which point the loop ends.
4. **Close the File**: The file is automatically closed after the reading process is done, thanks to the `defer file.Close()` statement.

### Summary:
- This code reads a CSV file (`my.csv`), processes each record line by line, and prints the content of each record to the console. It stops when the end of the file is reached or when an error occurs. The `defer` statement ensures that the file is closed after reading, preventing resource leaks.
