The given Go code performs two primary tasks: **writing data to a CSV file** and **reading data from that CSV file**. Let's break it down step by step:

---

## **1. Import Packages**
```go
import (
	"encoding/csv"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)
```
- `encoding/csv`: Provides functions to read from and write to CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files.
- `fmt`: For printing messages to the console.
- `os`: For file handling (creating, opening, and closing files).

---

## **2. Writing Data to CSV**
### **Data to write:**
```go
rows := [][]string{
	{"1", "2", "3"},
	{"4", "5", "6"},
}
```
This is a 2D slice (a slice of slices) representing rows and columns of CSV data.

### **Creating a CSV file:**
```go
writeFile := "my.csv1"
file, err := os.Create(writeFile)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println("Error creating file:", err)
	return
}
defer file.Close()
```
- `os.Create()`: Creates the file `my.csv1`. If the file already exists, it will be truncated (emptied).
- `defer file.Close()`: Ensures that the file is closed when the function exits, preventing resource leaks.

### **Writing data to the CSV file:**
```go
writer := csv.NewWriter(file)
defer writer.Flush()
```
- `csv.NewWriter(file)`: Creates a CSV writer that writes to the `file`.
- `defer writer.Flush()`: Ensures all buffered data is written to the file before the program finishes.

### **Write each row to the CSV:**
```go
for _, row := range rows {
	if err := writer.Write(row); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error writing record to file:", err)
		return
	}
}
```
- `writer.Write(row)`: Writes each row (a slice of strings) to the CSV file.
- If an error occurs while writing a row, it is printed and the program exits.

---

## **3. Reading Data from CSV**
### **Opening the CSV file:**
```go
readFile := "my.csv1"
file, err = os.Open(readFile)
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println("Error opening file:", err)
	return
}
defer file.Close()
```
- `os.Open()`: Opens the CSV file for reading.
- `defer file.Close()`: Ensures the file is closed after reading.

### **Creating a CSV reader:**
```go
reader := csv.NewReader(file)
```
- `csv.NewReader(file)`: Creates a CSV reader to read rows from the file.

### **Read the file row by row:**
```go
for {
	record, err := reader.Read()
	if err != nil {
		if err.Error() == "EOF" {
			break
		}
		fmt.Println("Error reading record:", err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Println(record)
}
```
- `reader.Read()`: Reads one row at a time.
- When the end of the file (`EOF`) is reached, the loop breaks.
- Each row (which is a slice of strings) is printed.

## âœ… **Final Output:**
```
[1 2 3]
[4 5 6]
```

## **4. Summary of Key Concepts:**
| Step            | Purpose                                               |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Writing CSV    | Creates a CSV file and writes rows of data to it. |
| Flushing Data  | Ensures data is written from the buffer to the file. |
| Reading CSV   | Reads the CSV file row by row. |
| Handling Errors | Manages errors during file creation, writing, and reading. |
