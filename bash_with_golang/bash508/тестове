Write a script that will optionally accept a timezone value and will print the list of users on the given timezone following a summary in the first line. If no timezone is given, then your script will list all the users without a summary line.

Users should be printed with only their names flattened as <title> <name> <surname>; e.g: Mr Daniel Wuollet
Sample output for <your_script> -t +10:00
2/50 users in timezone +10:00
Madame Roswitha Barbier
Miss Nicoline Mortensen

Sample output (without timezone) for <your_script>
Ms Mandy Collins
Miss Emeli Nesland
Miss Ariana Wood
Miss Norma Pati√±o
