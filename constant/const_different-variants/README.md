This Go program demonstrates key rules about **constants and types**. Let's break it down step-by-step:

---

## ‚úÖ **1. Constant Declaration**
```go
const pi = 3.14
```
- This is an **untyped constant**, which means it **doesn't have a fixed type** and can be **implicitly converted** when used with different types.

---

## ‚úÖ **2. Multiple Constant Declaration**
```go
const (
	hello = "–ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç"
	e     = 2.718
)
```
- Multiple constants can be declared within a single `const` block.

---

## ‚úÖ **3. Using `iota` for Auto-Incrementing Constants**
```go
const (
	zero  = iota  // 0
	_            // Skip value
	three        // 2 (because iota increments automatically)
)
```
- `iota` is a special constant that **auto-increments** with each line.
- The underscore `_` is used to **skip the value**, so `three` becomes `2`.

---

## ‚úÖ **4. Typed vs. Untyped Constants**
```go
const (
	year     = 2017       // Untyped constant
	yearType int = 2017  // Typed constant (int type explicitly set)
)
```
- An **untyped constant** like `year` can be used with any compatible type.
- A **typed constant** like `yearType` has a **fixed type** and **cannot be mixed with different types**.

---

## ‚úÖ **5. Implicit Type Conversion with Untyped Constant**
```go
var month int32 = 13

fmt.Println(year + month) // Works fine (2030)
```
- Since `year` is **untyped**, it can be implicitly converted to `int32`, which is the type of `month`.

---

## ‚ùå **6. Type Mismatch with Typed Constant**
```go
// fmt.Println(yearType + month) // Error: mismatched types int and int32
```
- `yearType` is explicitly declared as an `int`, so **Go does not allow mixing `int` with `int32`**, resulting in a **type mismatch error**.

---

## üéØ **Key Takeaways:**
1. **Untyped constants are more flexible** and can work with different types.
2. **Typed constants are more strict** and enforce type compatibility.
3. `iota` is useful for **auto-incrementing constants**.
4. You can **skip `iota` values** using an underscore `_`.
