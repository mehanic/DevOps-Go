This Go program demonstrates the use of the `iota` identifier in defining a sequence of constants. Let's break down the rules and behavior:

### 1. **The `iota` Mechanism**
   - `iota` is a built-in constant generator in Go that automatically increments with each line in a `const` block.
   - It starts at **0** and increments by **1** for each new line in the block.

### 2. **Constant Declaration Block**
   ```go
   const (
       Sunday = iota
       Monday
       Tuesday
       Wednesday
       Thursday
       Friday
       Partyday
       numberOfDays // this constant is not exported
   )
   ```
   - The first constant `Sunday` is explicitly assigned `iota`, which starts at **0**.
   - Each subsequent constant automatically takes the next value of `iota`, incrementing by **1**.
   - This means:
     - `Sunday = 0`
     - `Monday = 1`
     - `Tuesday = 2`
     - `Wednesday = 3`
     - `Thursday = 4`
     - `Friday = 5`
     - `Partyday = 6`
     - `numberOfDays = 7`

### 3. **The Role of `numberOfDays`**
   - `numberOfDays` is simply another constant in the sequence. It captures the final value of `iota`, which is **7**.
   - It's not meant to represent a day of the week but serves as a convenient way to count the total number of items (in this case, days).

### 4. **Why `numberOfDays` is Not Exported**
   - In Go, **exported identifiers** (i.e., those accessible from other packages) must start with an **uppercase letter**.
   - Since `numberOfDays` starts with a lowercase letter, it is **not exported**, meaning it cannot be accessed from outside the package.

### 5. **Output**
   ```go
   println(numberOfDays) // Outputs: 7
   ```
   - The `println` function prints the value of `numberOfDays`, which is `7`.

### 6. **Use Cases**
   - This pattern is often used in **enums** (enumerations), where `iota` allows you to efficiently generate a series of related constants.
   - The `numberOfDays` constant is useful for counting the number of elements without manually updating the count if new constants are added.

### ✅ **Key Takeaways**
1. `iota` starts at 0 and increments automatically.
2. If you don’t explicitly assign a value, Go assigns the current `iota` value.
3. The `numberOfDays` constant is useful for counting elements.
4. Lowercase constants are not exported in Go.
