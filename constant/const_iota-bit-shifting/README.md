This Go code demonstrates **bit shifting** and how it can be used to calculate powers of two. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the code and the rules behind it:

### Code Breakdown:

```go
const (
	_  = iota             // 0
	KB = 1 << (iota * 10) // 1 << (1 * 10)
	MB = 1 << (iota * 10) // 1 << (2 * 10)
	GB = 1 << (iota * 10) // 1 << (3 * 10)
	TB = 1 << (iota * 10) // 1 << (4 * 10)
)
```

1. **Iota and Bit Shifting:**
   - **`iota`** is used here to generate a sequence of values, which are then used for bit shifting.
   - In the `const` block:
     - `iota` starts at `0` and increments for each line in the block.
     - The expression `1 << (iota * 10)` performs a **left bit shift** operation on the number `1`.

2. **Left Bit Shift (`<<`):**
   - The operator `<<` is the **left shift** operator. It shifts the bits of the number to the left by a specified number of positions, which is equivalent to multiplying the number by `2^n` (where `n` is the number of positions you shift).
   - **`1 << (iota * 10)`** shifts the number `1` to the left by `iota * 10` positions:
     - For `iota = 1`, it shifts `1` left by 10 positions, which is `2^10 = 1024` (the number of bytes in a kilobyte).
     - For `iota = 2`, it shifts `1` left by 20 positions, which is `2^20 = 1,048,576` (the number of bytes in a megabyte).
     - For `iota = 3`, it shifts `1` left by 30 positions, which is `2^30 = 1,073,741,824` (the number of bytes in a gigabyte).
     - For `iota = 4`, it shifts `1` left by 40 positions, which is `2^40 = 1,099,511,627,776` (the number of bytes in a terabyte).

3. **The `const` Block:**
   - **`KB = 1 << (iota * 10)`**: This calculates `1024` (or `2^10`), which is the number of bytes in a kilobyte.
   - **`MB = 1 << (iota * 10)`**: This calculates `1,048,576` (or `2^20`), which is the number of bytes in a megabyte.
   - **`GB = 1 << (iota * 10)`**: This calculates `1,073,741,824` (or `2^30`), which is the number of bytes in a gigabyte.
   - **`TB = 1 << (iota * 10)`**: This calculates `1,099,511,627,776` (or `2^40`), which is the number of bytes in a terabyte.

4. **The Output:**
   The program prints the binary representation (`%b`) and the decimal value (`%d`) for each of these constants:

   ```go
   fmt.Println("binary\t\tdecimal")
   fmt.Printf("%b\t", KB)
   fmt.Printf("%d\n", KB)
   fmt.Printf("%b\t", MB)
   fmt.Printf("%d\n", MB)
   fmt.Printf("%b\t", GB)
   fmt.Printf("%d\n", GB)
   fmt.Printf("%b\t", TB)
   fmt.Printf("%d\n", TB)
   ```

   The output will be:
   ```
   binary		decimal
   10000000000	1024
   100000000000000000000	1048576
   1000000000000000000000000000000	1073741824
   10000000000000000000000000000000000000000	1099511627776
   ```

   - **Binary Representation:** The `binary` column shows the binary representation of the values.
     - `1024` in binary is `10000000000` (i.e., `2^10`).
     - `1,048,576` in binary is `100000000000000000000` (i.e., `2^20`).
     - `1,073,741,824` in binary is `1000000000000000000000000000000` (i.e., `2^30`).
     - `1,099,511,627,776` in binary is `10000000000000000000000000000000000000000` (i.e., `2^40`).
   
   - **Decimal Value:** The `decimal` column shows the corresponding decimal values (1024, 1,048,576, 1,073,741,824, 1,099,511,627,776).

### Explanation of Bit Shifting in Context:
1. **Bit Shifting and Powers of 2:**
   - The left bit shift `1 << n` is equivalent to multiplying the number `1` by `2^n`. This is the core idea here. For example:
     - `1 << 10` is `2^10 = 1024` (which is the size of 1 KB in bytes).
     - `1 << 20` is `2^20 = 1,048,576` (which is the size of 1 MB in bytes).
     - Similarly, for `GB` and `TB`, the values are `2^30` and `2^40`, respectively.

2. **Memory Units:**
   - This code uses bit shifting to represent the sizes of memory units:
     - **Kilobyte (KB):** 1024 bytes (2^10).
     - **Megabyte (MB):** 1,048,576 bytes (2^20).
     - **Gigabyte (GB):** 1,073,741,824 bytes (2^30).
     - **Terabyte (TB):** 1,099,511,627,776 bytes (2^40).
   
   These are common sizes used in computing to measure data storage or memory capacity.

### Conclusion:
- **Bit shifting** is a powerful technique in Go (and other programming languages) for efficiently performing operations involving powers of 2.
- The **left shift operator (`<<`)** is used here to generate the sizes of common memory units like KB, MB, GB, and TB by shifting `1` left by specific numbers of bits, corresponding to powers of 2.
- The **`iota`** is used to simplify the generation of the constants for each unit (KB, MB, GB, TB).
