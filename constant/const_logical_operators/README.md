In the Go code you've provided, the main focus is on logical operators and comparisons between different values. Let me break it down step by step to explain how the logic works.

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Commented Out Comparison Operators:**
   ```go
   //x, y := 3, "b" // 98
   /*fmt.Printf("%T, %v\n", x == y, x == y)
   fmt.Printf("%T, %v\n", x != y, x != y)
   fmt.Printf("%T, %v\n", x < y, x < y)
   fmt.Printf("%T, %v\n", x > y, x > y)
   fmt.Printf("%T, %v\n", x >= y, x >= y)
   fmt.Printf("%T, %v\n", x <= y, x <= y) */
   // farklı veri tipleri karşılaştırlamz !!!
   ```
   - These lines are commented out, but they demonstrate **comparison operators** between `x` and `y`. The important thing to note here is that **comparison between different types (like an `int` and a `string`) will result in an error** because Go is a statically-typed language and requires both variables to be of the same type for comparison. This will cause a compilation error.
   - For example, comparing an `int` (`x = 3`) with a `string` (`y = "b"`) will result in a **compile-time error**.
   - So, the message "**farklı veri tipleri karşılaştırılmaz!!!**" (which means "different data types cannot be compared" in Turkish) is a correct observation.

2. **Setting up boolean values and logical operators:**
   ```go
   set3 := false
   ```
   - A boolean variable `set3` is initialized with the value `false`.

3. **Logical NOT operator:**
   ```go
   fmt.Printf("%v\n", (!set3))
   ```
   - **`!`** is the **logical NOT operator**, which negates the value of a boolean expression.
   - Since `set3` is `false`, **`!set3`** will evaluate to `true` because the **NOT** of `false` is `true`.
   - **Output:** `true`

### Logical Operators:

There are other logical operators in Go that you can use in comparisons or conditions:

1. **AND (`&&`)**: The AND operator requires both conditions to be true for the result to be true. If either condition is false, the result is false.
   - Example: `(set1 && set2)` - This checks if both `set1` and `set2` are true. If both are true, the result is true; otherwise, it's false.

2. **OR (`||`)**: The OR operator requires at least one condition to be true for the result to be true. If both conditions are false, the result is false.
   - Example: `(set3 || set2)` - This checks if either `set3` or `set2` is true. If either is true, the result is true; otherwise, it's false.

3. **NOT (`!`)**: The NOT operator inverts the boolean value of a condition.
   - Example: `(!set3)` - If `set3` is false, `!set3` will be true.

### Summary of Output:

- Since the variable `set3` is `false`, the expression `(!set3)` will evaluate to `true`.
- Therefore, the output of the program will be:
  ```
  true
  ```

### Explanation of Commented-Out Logical Expressions:

- The code mentions expressions with **`&&`** and **`||`**, but they are commented out:
  - **`set1 && set2`** would be `true` only if both `set1` and `set2` are `true`.
  - **`set3 || set2`** would be `true` if either `set3` or `set2` is `true`.
  - In both cases, it would print the result of the logical operation between the two boolean variables.

### Conclusion:

- **Comparison operators** in Go only work between values of the **same type**. Attempting to compare variables of different types, like `int` and `string`, will lead to a compile-time error.
- **Logical operators** (like `&&`, `||`, and `!`) are used to combine or negate boolean expressions.
- The **NOT operator** (`!`) negates the boolean value, so the expression `(!set3)` evaluates to `true` since `set3` is `false`.
