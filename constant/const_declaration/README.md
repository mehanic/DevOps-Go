This Go program demonstrates **type definitions**, **custom types**, and **constant assignment rules**. Let's break it down step by step:

---

## **1. Custom Type Declaration**
```go
type foo int
```
- This creates a **custom type `foo`**, which is based on the underlying type `int`.
- Even though `foo` is based on `int`, **Go treats it as a completely distinct type**.

---

## **2. Variable Declaration**
```go
var y foo
```
- The variable `y` is declared with the type `foo`.

---

## **3. Constant Declaration**
```go
const bar = 42
```
- `bar` is a **constant with an untyped value of 42**.
- Since it's **untyped**, it can be implicitly converted to any compatible type, including `foo`.

---

## **4. Assignment**
```go
y = bar
```
- Normally, assigning an `int` to a `foo` variable would cause a **type mismatch error**.
- However, **because `bar` is an untyped constant**, it can be **directly assigned to any numeric type**, including `foo`.
- If `bar` were a typed constant (`const bar int = 42`), this assignment would result in a **compilation error**.

---

## **5. Type Printing**
```go
fmt.Printf("%T\n", y)   // main.foo
fmt.Printf("%T\n", bar) // int
```
- `y` is of type `main.foo` (the custom type).
- `bar` is treated as an `int`, because untyped numeric constants default to `int` when used in expressions.

---

## âœ… **Key Takeaways**:
1. **Custom types are distinct from their underlying types**, even if they are based on `int`, `float`, etc.
2. **Untyped constants are flexible** and can be assigned to any compatible type.
3. If `bar` were explicitly typed as `int`, assigning it to `y` would cause a **type mismatch error**.
