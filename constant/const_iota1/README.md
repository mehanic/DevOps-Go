In this Go code, we are using **`iota`** in two separate constant blocks. Let's break down how **`iota`** behaves in each block:

### Code Breakdown:

```go
const (
	a = iota // 0
	b        // 1
	c        // 2
)

// defining a second iota will start at 0
const (
	d = iota // 0
	e        // 1
	f        // 2
)
```

### Explanation:

1. **First Constant Block:**
   ```go
   const (
       a = iota // 0
       b        // 1
       c        // 2
   )
   ```
   - **`iota`** is a special Go keyword that starts at `0` for the first constant in each **constant block** and **increments** by `1` for each subsequent constant in that block.
   - For the first constant block:
     - **`a = iota`**: `iota` starts at `0`, so `a = 0`.
     - **`b`**: `iota` increments to `1`, so `b = 1`.
     - **`c`**: `iota` increments again to `2`, so `c = 2`.
   
   **Values after the first block:**
   - `a = 0`
   - `b = 1`
   - `c = 2`

2. **Second Constant Block:**
   ```go
   const (
       d = iota // 0
       e        // 1
       f        // 2
   )
   ```
   - Each **constant block** in Go **gets its own independent `iota` counter**, meaning when you start a new constant block, `iota` **resets to `0`**.
   - For the second constant block:
     - **`d = iota`**: `iota` starts over at `0`, so `d = 0`.
     - **`e`**: `iota` increments to `1`, so `e = 1`.
     - **`f`**: `iota` increments again to `2`, so `f = 2`.

   **Values after the second block:**
   - `d = 0`
   - `e = 1`
   - `f = 2`

### Key Rules:
- **`iota` resets to `0`** for each **new constant block**.
- Within each block, **`iota` increments automatically** with each new constant declaration.
- If you have multiple constant blocks, **each block will have its own independent `iota`** counter starting at `0` and incrementing within that block only.

### Output:
The output of the `main` function will be:

```
0
1
2
0
1
2
```

### Summary:
- The first block defines constants `a`, `b`, and `c` using `iota`, which starts at `0` and increments with each constant.
- The second block starts with `iota` again at `0` and increments for constants `d`, `e`, and `f`.
- **`iota` is reset at the start of each new block**.
