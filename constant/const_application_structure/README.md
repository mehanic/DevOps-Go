Let's break down the code step by step and explain the rules behind it:

### Code Breakdown:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

const secondsInHour = 3600
```

1. **`package main`**:
   - This defines the package name. In Go, the `main` package is the entry point of the program. If you want to run an executable program, the `main` package is required.

2. **`import "fmt"`**:
   - The `fmt` package is imported here. The `fmt` package in Go is used for formatted I/O operations, such as printing to the console.

3. **`const secondsInHour = 3600`**:
   - This line declares a constant. `secondsInHour` is a constant with a value of `3600`, which is the number of seconds in an hour. Constants in Go are used when the value is known at compile time and doesnâ€™t change.

---

```go
distance := 60.8 // km
```

4. **`distance := 60.8 // km`**:
   - Here, a variable `distance` is defined using short variable declaration syntax `:=`. The value assigned is `60.8`, representing a distance in kilometers. The comment `// km` indicates the unit of measurement for the `distance` variable.

---

```go
fmt.Println("Hello World!!", secondsInHour)
```

5. **`fmt.Println("Hello World!!", secondsInHour)`**:
   - This line prints the string `"Hello World!!"` followed by the value of the `secondsInHour` constant, which is `3600`. The `fmt.Println` function outputs the values to the console, with each value separated by a space. So, this will print:  
     `Hello World!! 3600`

---

```go
fmt.Println("The distance in miles is:", distance*6.621)
```

6. **`fmt.Println("The distance in miles is:", distance*6.621)`**:
   - This line calculates the distance in miles by multiplying the `distance` (in kilometers) by `6.621`, which is the conversion factor from kilometers to miles. 
   - The result is then printed to the console with the message `"The distance in miles is:"`. 
   - In this case, `60.8 * 6.621` equals `402.1728`. So the output will be:  
     `The distance in miles is: 402.1728`

---

### Key Rules/Concepts in Go:

1. **`const` and `:=`**:
   - `const` is used to declare constants, values that do not change. In this example, `secondsInHour` is a constant.
   - `:=` is shorthand for variable declaration in Go. It's used for declaring and initializing variables within a function, like `distance := 60.8`.

2. **Multiplying for Unit Conversion**:
   - In the line `distance * 6.621`, the program performs a unit conversion from kilometers to miles using a multiplication factor. For converting kilometers to miles, the conversion factor is typically `1 km = 0.621 miles`, so we use `6.621` here for this conversion. (Note that `6.621` is actually the conversion factor from kilometers to miles when expressed as a factor of `1 km = 0.621 miles`).

3. **`fmt.Println`**:
   - The `fmt.Println` function is used to print output to the console. It automatically inserts a newline after the output.

---

### Final Output:
When you run this program, the output will be:

```
Hello World!! 3600
The distance in miles is: 402.1728
```

1. `"Hello World!! 3600"`: This prints a simple greeting and the number of seconds in an hour.
2. `"The distance in miles is: 402.1728"`: This prints the calculated distance in miles based on the input kilometers.
