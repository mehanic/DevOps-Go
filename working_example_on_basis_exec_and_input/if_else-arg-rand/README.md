### **Explanation of the Code:**

This code is a number guessing game where the program thinks of a random number between 1 and 20, and the user must guess it within 6 tries. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program works:

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Importing Required Packages**
```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"strconv"
	"time"
)
```
- `fmt`: For formatted input and output (e.g., printing messages to the user).
- `math/rand`: For generating random numbers.
- `strconv`: For converting strings to integers.
- `time`: For generating random numbers based on the current time (to ensure randomness).

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Initializing Random Seed**
```go
rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())
```
- `rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())` initializes the random number generator using the current time in nanoseconds. This ensures that the random numbers generated will be different each time the program is run.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Generating the Secret Number**
```go
secretNumber := rand.Intn(20) + 1
```
- `rand.Intn(20)` generates a random number between 0 and 19. By adding `1`, the range is adjusted to be between **1 and 20**.
- This is the **secret number** the user will try to guess.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Introducing the Game to the User**
```go
fmt.Println("I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.")
```
- This line informs the user about the range of the secret number (between 1 and 20).

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up Variables**
```go
var guess int
var guessesTaken int
```
- `guess`: This stores the user's current guess.
- `guessesTaken`: This tracks how many guesses the user has made so far.

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Guessing Loop**
```go
for guessesTaken = 1; guessesTaken <= 6; guessesTaken++ {
    fmt.Print("Take a guess: ")
    var input string
    fmt.Scan(&input)

    guess, err := strconv.Atoi(input)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
        guessesTaken-- // Do not count invalid guesses
        continue
    }
    // Rest of the guessing logic
}
```
- The program gives the user **6 chances** to guess the secret number (`guessesTaken <= 6`).
- For each guess, the program asks the user to **input a guess** with `fmt.Print("Take a guess: ")`.
- `fmt.Scan(&input)` reads the user's input as a **string** and stores it in the variable `input`.
- The program then **converts the input** to an integer using `strconv.Atoi(input)`. If the conversion fails (i.e., the input is not a number), it returns an error, and the program asks the user to input a valid number without counting this guess (`guessesTaken--`).

---

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Guess Comparison**
```go
if guess < secretNumber {
    fmt.Println("Your guess is too low.")
} else if guess > secretNumber {
    fmt.Println("Your guess is too high.")
} else {
    break // Correct guess
}
```
- The program compares the user's guess to the secret number:
  - If the guess is **too low**, it prints: `"Your guess is too low."`
  - If the guess is **too high**, it prints: `"Your guess is too high."`
  - If the guess is **correct**, the program breaks out of the loop using `break`.

---

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ End of the Game**
```go
if guess == secretNumber {
    fmt.Printf("Good job! You guessed my number in %d guesses!\n", guessesTaken)
} else {
    fmt.Printf("Nope. The number I was thinking of was %d\n", secretNumber)
}
```
- If the guess is correct, the program congratulates the user, printing how many guesses it took to find the secret number.
- If the guess is incorrect after 6 attempts, the program reveals the secret number.

### **üîπ Example Walkthrough:**

#### **Example 1: Correct Guess**
1. **Program Output**:
   ```
   I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.
   Take a guess: 6
   Your guess is too low.
   Take a guess: 9
   Your guess is too low.
   Take a guess: 14
   Good job! You guessed my number in 3 guesses!
   ```
   - The program selects a secret number (e.g., `14`).
   - The user guesses `6`, and the program tells them the guess is too low.
   - The user guesses `9`, and the program again tells them the guess is too low.
   - The user guesses `14`, which is the correct number, and the program congratulates them, showing the number of guesses (3 in this case).

#### **Example 2: Incorrect Guess**
1. **Program Output**:
   ```
   I am thinking of a number between 1 and 20.
   Take a guess: 6
   Your guess is too low.
   Take a guess: 9
   Your guess is too low.
   Take a guess: 14
   Nope. The number I was thinking of was 14
   ```
   - The user fails to guess the correct number in the allowed attempts and is told the correct number at the end.

---

### **üîπ Key Points to Note:**

- **Random Number Generation**: The program generates a random number between 1 and 20 using `rand.Intn(20) + 1`.
- **User Input Validation**: The program checks if the user has entered a valid number. If not, it prompts the user again without counting that as a valid guess.
- **Guessing Logic**: Each guess is compared to the secret number, and the program gives feedback whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct.
- **Limited Guesses**: The user has 6 guesses in total. After 6 incorrect guesses, the game ends, and the secret number is revealed.
