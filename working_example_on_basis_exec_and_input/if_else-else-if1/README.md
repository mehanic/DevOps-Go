This Go program prompts the user to input their age, then determines the price of the ticket based on the age entered. It handles input validation and conditional logic to output different ticket prices based on the user's age.

### **1. Age Input and Error Handling**
```go
fmt.Print("Please enter your age under here: ")
_, err := fmt.Scan(&age)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Invalid input. Please enter a number.")
}
```
- **Explanation**: 
  - The program prompts the user to enter their age using `fmt.Print`.
  - `fmt.Scan(&age)` reads the user's input and stores it in the variable `age`. It returns two values: the number of items successfully scanned (which is ignored here) and an error (`err`) if the input is invalid (e.g., if the user enters a non-numeric value).
  - If there is an error (i.e., the input isn't a valid integer), the program logs an error message and terminates using `log.Fatal`.

### **2. Conditional Logic for Ticket Price**
```go
if age < 3 {
    fmt.Println("Your ticket is free")
} else if age >= 3 && age <= 12 {
    fmt.Println("Your ticket needs 10 dollars")
} else if age > 12 {
    fmt.Println("Your ticket needs 15 dollars")
}
```
- **Explanation**:
  - **First `if` condition**: `if age < 3`
    - If the user is younger than 3 years old, the program prints `"Your ticket is free"`.
  - **`else if` condition**: `else if age >= 3 && age <= 12`
    - If the user is between 3 and 12 years old (inclusive), the program prints `"Your ticket needs 10 dollars"`.
  - **`else if` condition**: `else if age > 12`
    - If the user is older than 12 years, the program prints `"Your ticket needs 15 dollars"`.
  
### **3. Example of Execution**
For the input:
```
Please enter your age under here: 30
```
- The program will check the conditions:
  - `30` is not less than `3`, so it doesn't enter the first `if`.
  - `30` is greater than `12`, so the program enters the last `else if` and prints `"Your ticket needs 15 dollars"`.

### **Final Output**:
```
Please enter your age under here: 30
Your ticket needs 15 dollars
```

### **Summary of Rules and Flow**:
1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `fmt.Scan` to take user input, checks for errors, and validates that the input is a valid number.
2. **Conditional Logic**: 
   - If the user is under 3 years old, the ticket is free.
   - If the user is between 3 and 12 years old, the ticket costs 10 dollars.
   - If the user is older than 12 years, the ticket costs 15 dollars.
3. **Error Handling**: If the user enters invalid input (not a number), the program stops and outputs an error message.

This program is a basic example of handling user input, validating it, and using conditional logic to provide different outputs based on input.
