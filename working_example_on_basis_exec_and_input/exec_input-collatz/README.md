### Explanation of the Go Program (Collatz Conjecture):

This Go program calculates the Collatz sequence for a given integer number. The Collatz conjecture states that for any positive integer `n`, if `n` is even, divide it by 2; if `n` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat this process with the resulting number until the number becomes 1. This program implements that process and prints the sequence.

Letâ€™s break down the code:

### 1. **Imports**:
```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strconv"
)
```
- `fmt`: For formatted I/O operations, such as reading and writing data.
- `os`: For accessing operating system functions, such as exiting the program with an error.
- `strconv`: For converting strings to other data types, such as integers and floats.

### 2. **Collatz Function**:
```go
func collatz(number int) int {
	if number%2 == 0 {
		return number / 2
	}
	return 3*number + 1
}
```
- This function implements the **Collatz** operation:
  - If `number` is **even** (`number % 2 == 0`), it divides the number by 2.
  - If `number` is **odd**, it multiplies the number by 3 and adds 1.
- It returns the result of the operation, which will be used to continue the sequence.

### 3. **Main Function**:
```go
func main() {
	fmt.Print("Enter integer number:    ")
	var input string
	fmt.Scanln(&input)

	number, err := strconv.ParseFloat(input, 64)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("The integer number is only accepted.")
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	if number == float64(int(number)) {
		fmt.Println(int(number))
		for number != 1 {
			number = float64(collatz(int(number)))
			fmt.Println(int(number))
		}
	} else {
		fmt.Println("The integer number is only accepted.")
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}
```

- **Input Handling**:
  - The program asks the user to input an integer by printing: `Enter integer number:    `.
  - It stores the user's input in the `input` variable (as a string).
  - It then tries to convert that string into a floating-point number using `strconv.ParseFloat()`. This allows the user to enter the number in any valid format (e.g., with a decimal point), though only integer values will be accepted.

- **Error Handling for Invalid Input**:
  - If the conversion fails (`err != nil`), the program will print an error message: `"The integer number is only accepted."` and exit using `os.Exit(1)`.

- **Check for Integer Input**:
  - The program checks if the input is a valid integer by comparing the float value to the integer value of the number: `if number == float64(int(number))`. This ensures that the user entered an integer (no decimals).
  - If the number is not an integer, it prints the error message and exits.

- **Calculating and Printing the Collatz Sequence**:
  - If the input is a valid integer, the program prints the number and starts the Collatz sequence.
  - It continuously applies the `collatz()` function to the number and prints each result until the number becomes `1`.
  - For each iteration, the number is converted to an integer for printing.

### 4. **Collatz Sequence Process**:
- The program will repeatedly apply the Collatz function to the number and print each step.
- For example, if the user enters `67`, the program will print the following sequence:
  ```
  67
  202
  101
  304
  152
  76
  38
  19
  58
  29
  88
  44
  22
  11
  34
  17
  52
  26
  13
  40
  20
  10
  5
  16
  8
  4
  2
  1
  ```
- This continues until the number becomes `1`, as required by the Collatz conjecture.

### 5. **Exit on Invalid Input**:
If the input is not a valid integer or if the number contains decimals, the program will print the message:
```
The integer number is only accepted.
```
and terminate with an exit code `1`.

### Key Takeaways:
- The Collatz conjecture operates by performing two steps: if the number is even, divide by 2; if the number is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1.
- The program accepts only integers and ensures that no non-integer or decimal input is processed.
- It handles errors gracefully, ensuring that invalid inputs are caught, and provides a simple interface to run the algorithm for any integer entered.

### Example of Usage:
```sh
$ go run main.go
Enter integer number:    67
67
202
101
304
152
76
38
19
58
29
88
44
22
11
34
17
52
26
13
40
20
10
5
16
8
4
2
1
```
The program will print the Collatz sequence for the input `67`.
