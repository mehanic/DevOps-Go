Let's break down and explain the code, and how it works in detail, including the behavior of the program when fewer than three arguments are provided.

### Code Explanation:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	var (
		l  = len(os.Args) - 1 // Number of arguments provided (excluding the program name)
		n1 = os.Args[1]       // First name (from the command line argument)
		n2 = os.Args[2]       // Second name (from the command line argument)
		n3 = os.Args[3]       // Third name (from the command line argument)
	)

	// Print the number of people (based on the number of arguments)
	fmt.Println("There are", l, "people !")

	// Print greeting messages for each name provided
	fmt.Println("Hello great", n1, "!")
	fmt.Println("Hello great", n2, "!")
	fmt.Println("Hello great", n3, "!")

	// Print a final message
	fmt.Println("Nice to meet you all.")
}
```

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **`os.Args`**:
   - `os.Args` is a slice that contains the command-line arguments passed to the program.
   - `os.Args[0]` is always the name of the program (or the path to it, depending on how it is invoked).
   - `os.Args[1]`, `os.Args[2]`, `os.Args[3]`, etc., are the arguments passed to the program when it is run.

2. **Variables**:
   - `l = len(os.Args) - 1`: This line calculates the number of arguments passed to the program, excluding `os.Args[0]` (the program's name). It subtracts 1 from the length of `os.Args` to exclude the program name.
   - `n1 = os.Args[1]`: This assigns the first command-line argument (excluding the program name) to the variable `n1`.
   - `n2 = os.Args[2]`: Similarly, assigns the second command-line argument to `n2`.
   - `n3 = os.Args[3]`: Assigns the third command-line argument to `n3`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints:
     - The number of arguments (people), excluding the program name.
     - A greeting for each of the first three arguments (`n1`, `n2`, `n3`).
     - A final message: `"Nice to meet you all."`.

### Behavior:

When the program is executed with the following command:

```bash
go run main.go Alice Bob Charlie
```

- `os.Args` will be: `["main.go", "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]`
- The length `l` will be `3` (because there are 3 arguments, excluding the program name).
- The program will output:

```text
There are 3 people !
Hello great Alice !
Hello great Bob !
Hello great Charlie !
Nice to meet you all.
```

### **Handling Fewer than 3 Arguments**:

If fewer than three names are provided, the program will panic and cause an index out of range error because it is trying to access `os.Args[1]`, `os.Args[2]`, and `os.Args[3]` directly without any validation. 

### Improved Version with Argument Check:

To handle cases where fewer than 3 arguments are provided, you could modify the program to check the number of arguments before trying to access them. This would avoid the panic and provide a more user-friendly message.

Hereâ€™s an improved version of the code that handles this scenario:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	// Check if there are enough arguments
	if len(os.Args) < 4 {
		fmt.Println("Please provide at least 3 names.")
		return
	}

	var (
		l  = len(os.Args) - 1 // Number of people
		n1 = os.Args[1]       // First name
		n2 = os.Args[2]       // Second name
		n3 = os.Args[3]       // Third name
	)

	fmt.Println("There are", l, "people !")
	fmt.Println("Hello great", n1, "!")
	fmt.Println("Hello great", n2, "!")
	fmt.Println("Hello great", n3, "!")
	fmt.Println("Nice to meet you all.")
}
```

### Behavior with Fewer Than 3 Arguments:

Now, if you run the program with fewer than three arguments:

```bash
go run main.go Alice Bob
```

- The program will print:

```text
Please provide at least 3 names.
```

This will prevent the program from crashing due to an "index out of range" error.

### Example Scenarios:

1. **Running with 3 Arguments**:
   ```bash
   go run main.go Alice Bob Charlie
   ```
   Output:
   ```text
   There are 3 people !
   Hello great Alice !
   Hello great Bob !
   Hello great Charlie !
   Nice to meet you all.
   ```

2. **Running with 2 Arguments**:
   ```bash
   go run main.go Alice Bob
   ```
   Output:
   ```text
   Please provide at least 3 names.
   ```

3. **Running with 1 Argument**:
   ```bash
   go run main.go Alice
   ```
   Output:
   ```text
   Please provide at least 3 names.
   ```

### Summary of the Rules:

- The program assumes that three names will be passed as command-line arguments.
- If exactly three names are provided, it prints a greeting for each one.
- If fewer than three names are provided, an error message is displayed (in the improved version).
- The program calculates the number of names by subtracting `1` from the length of `os.Args`, as the first element of `os.Args` is always the program's name.
