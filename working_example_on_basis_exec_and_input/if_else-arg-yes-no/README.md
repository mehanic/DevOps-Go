### **Explanation of the Code:**

This program checks if a person can afford a monthly price by comparing their salary to the required amount for a monthly payment. Let's break it down step-by-step:

---

### **1️⃣ Importing the `fmt` Package**
```go
import "fmt"
```
- The `fmt` package is used to handle formatted input and output. It's used here to read user input (`fmt.Scanf()`) and print output (`fmt.Println()`).

---

### **2️⃣ Declaring Variables**
```go
var salary, month, price int
```
- The program declares three variables:
  - `salary`: The monthly salary of the person (in this case, an integer value).
  - `month`: The number of months over which a price will be divided (for example, rent or a loan).
  - `price`: The total cost of something the person is paying for (like rent or an item they want to purchase).

---

### **3️⃣ Reading User Input**
```go
fmt.Scanf("%d", &salary)
fmt.Scanf("%d", &month)
fmt.Scanf("%d", &price)
```
- These lines read the values for `salary`, `month`, and `price` from the user using `fmt.Scanf()`. This function expects user input formatted as integers (`%d`).
  - **Example input**: 
    - `salary = 3000`
    - `month = 245`
    - `price = 567`
  
---

### **4️⃣ Calculating the Monthly Requirement**
```go
r := float64(price / month)
```
- Here, the program calculates the **monthly requirement** by dividing the total `price` by `month`:
  - `r` is the result of dividing the total price by the number of months, representing the amount of money that needs to be paid per month.
  - The division is done between integers, so the result will be an integer, but we are converting it to a float with `float64()` for more precise calculations.
  - **For example**:
    - `price = 567`
    - `month = 245`
    - `r = 567 / 245 = 2.3` (rounded down to 2 because of integer division).

---

### **5️⃣ Calculating the Amount the Person Can Afford**
```go
s := float64(salary) * 0.5
```
- This line calculates how much of their salary the person can spend on the required payment each month.
  - The program assumes the person can spend up to **50%** of their salary on this payment.
  - The salary is first converted to a `float64` using `float64(salary)` and then multiplied by `0.5`.
  - **For example**:
    - `salary = 3000`
    - `s = 3000 * 0.5 = 1500.0`

---

### **6️⃣ Comparing the Monthly Payment and Available Amount**
```go
if s >= r {
    fmt.Println("YES")
} else {
    fmt.Println("NO")
}
```
- This `if` statement checks if the person can afford the monthly payment:
  - If the amount they can spend (`s`) is **greater than or equal to** the monthly requirement (`r`), then the program prints `"YES"`.
  - If the person can't afford the payment, it prints `"NO"`.
  
  **In the example with the input**:
  - `s = 1500.0` (the person can afford 1500)
  - `r = 2.3` (the required amount per month is 2.3)
  - Since `1500.0 >= 2.3`, the program will output `"YES"`.

### **🔹 Example Walkthrough:**

#### **Input:**
```text
3000
245
567
```

#### **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
1. **salary = 3000**
   - The user has a salary of 3000.
   
2. **month = 245**
   - The price will be divided over 245 months.

3. **price = 567**
   - The total price to be paid is 567.

4. **Monthly Requirement Calculation:**
   - `r = 567 / 245 = 2.3` (monthly payment is 2.3)

5. **Affordable Payment Calculation:**
   - `s = 3000 * 0.5 = 1500.0` (they can afford 1500)

6. **Comparison:**
   - `s >= r` → `1500.0 >= 2.3`, so the result is `YES`.

#### **Output:**
```text
YES
```

### **🔹 Key Points to Remember:**
- **User Input**: The program takes three inputs (salary, months, and total price).
- **Monthly Requirement**: It calculates how much money needs to be paid per month by dividing the price by the number of months.
- **Affordable Amount**: The program assumes the person can afford 50% of their salary for the monthly payment.
- **Comparison**: It compares the amount the person can afford (`s`) to the monthly requirement (`r`).
- **Output**: If they can afford it, it prints `"YES"`, otherwise, it prints `"NO"`.
