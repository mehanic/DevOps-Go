This Go program allows the user to input a series of numbers, stores them in an array, calculates the sum of the numbers, and then prints the result. Let's break down the code and explain each step:

### **Code Breakdown:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var n int
	fmt.Print("n=")
	fmt.Scan(&n)
	var numbers [100]int
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		var number int
		fmt.Print("number=")
		fmt.Scan(&number)
		numbers[i] = number
	}
	sumi := 0
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		sumi = sumi + numbers[i]
	}
	fmt.Println(sumi)
}
```

### **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Variable Declaration and Input:**
   ```go
   var n int
   fmt.Print("n=")
   fmt.Scan(&n)
   ```
   - A variable `n` is declared, which will represent the number of inputs (or how many numbers the user wants to input).
   - The program then asks the user to input a value for `n` using `fmt.Scan(&n)`. This is the number of elements the user will enter into the array.

2. **Array Declaration:**
   ```go
   var numbers [100]int
   ```
   - An array `numbers` of size 100 is declared to store the input values. The array is pre-allocated with space for 100 integers, but the program will only use the first `n` elements, depending on the user's input.

3. **Loop to Collect Numbers:**
   ```go
   for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
       var number int
       fmt.Print("number=")
       fmt.Scan(&number)
       numbers[i] = number
   }
   ```
   - A `for` loop runs `n` times. On each iteration, the program:
     - Declares a local variable `number` to store the user's input.
     - Prompts the user to enter a number by printing `"number="`.
     - Reads the number using `fmt.Scan(&number)` and assigns it to `numbers[i]`, where `i` is the current index in the loop.
   - This loop stores the user's input into the array `numbers`.

4. **Calculating the Sum:**
   ```go
   sumi := 0
   for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
       sumi = sumi + numbers[i]
   }
   ```
   - After collecting all the numbers, a new variable `sumi` is initialized to `0` to store the sum of the numbers.
   - Another `for` loop iterates over the first `n` elements of the array (`numbers[0]` to `numbers[n-1]`), adding each value to `sumi`.

5. **Displaying the Result:**
   ```go
   fmt.Println(sumi)
   ```
   - Finally, the program prints the sum of the numbers stored in `sumi` using `fmt.Println(sumi)`.

### **Example Walkthrough:**

- **Step 1:** The user is asked to input `n`. Suppose the user enters `3`:
   ```
   n=3
   ```
   
- **Step 2:** The program asks the user to input 3 numbers. For example:
   ```
   number=5
   number=10
   number=20
   ```
   These numbers are stored in the `numbers` array at indices 0, 1, and 2, respectively.

- **Step 3:** The program calculates the sum of these numbers. It will loop through the array and add up the values: `5 + 10 + 20 = 35`.

- **Step 4:** The program prints the result:
   ```
   35
   ```

### **Key Concepts in the Code:**

1. **Array:**
   - An array `numbers` of size 100 is used to store the numbers. Although the array has a fixed size, the program only uses the first `n` elements, where `n` is the number of inputs provided by the user.
   
2. **Input/Output:**
   - `fmt.Scan(&n)` and `fmt.Scan(&number)` are used to take user input.
   - `fmt.Print` is used to prompt the user for input, and `fmt.Println` is used to print the output (the sum of the numbers).
   
3. **For Loop:**
   - The program uses two `for` loops. The first loop collects `n` numbers from the user, and the second loop calculates the sum of the numbers.

4. **Summing Elements:**
   - The sum of the elements is computed using the loop. The variable `sumi` accumulates the sum by adding each element of the array to it.

### **Edge Case Considerations:**
- If `n = 0` (i.e., the user enters `0`), no numbers are inputted, and the sum will be `0` because the loops won't execute.
- If `n` is larger than the array size (`100`), the program may run into issues, as the array is only allocated for 100 integers. To handle this properly, you could limit the maximum value of `n` to 100 or dynamically allocate the array.

### **Summary:**
This program reads a specified number of integers from the user, stores them in an array, calculates their sum, and prints the result. It demonstrates the use of arrays, user input, and basic iteration in Go.
