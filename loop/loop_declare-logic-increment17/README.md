### Explanation of the Go Code:

This Go code performs a few basic operations on slices (`a`, `b`, and `c`) and prints the results at the end. Let’s break down each part of the code:

#### **1. Initializing and Modifying Slices:**
```go
a := []int{1, 2, 3, 45}
b := []int{}
c := []int{}
```
- `a` is initialized as a slice of integers with values `{1, 2, 3, 45}`.
- `b` and `c` are initialized as empty slices to store even and odd numbers, respectively.

#### **2. Appending Elements to `a`:**
```go
a = append(a, 3)
fmt.Println(a[3])
a = append(a, 123)
```
- The line `a = append(a, 3)` appends the number `3` to the slice `a`. Now, `a` will become `{1, 2, 3, 45, 3}`.
- The line `fmt.Println(a[3])` prints the element at index `3` in slice `a`. Since `a[3]` is `45` (remember that slice indices are 0-based), it will print `45`.
- Then, the line `a = append(a, 123)` appends `123` to `a`. Now, `a` will become `{1, 2, 3, 45, 3, 123}`.

#### **3. Looping Through Slice `a` to Separate Even and Odd Numbers:**
```go
for i := 0; i < len(a); i++ {
    if a[i]%2 == 0 {
        b = append(b, a[i])
    } else {
        c = append(c, a[i])
    }
}
```
- The `for` loop iterates through each element of slice `a` using index `i` from `0` to `len(a)-1` (the length of `a` is now `6`).
- Inside the loop, it checks whether the current number (`a[i]`) is even or odd:
  - If the number is even (`a[i] % 2 == 0`), it is appended to the slice `b` (which stores even numbers).
  - If the number is odd (`a[i] % 2 != 0`), it is appended to the slice `c` (which stores odd numbers).
  
This loop effectively divides `a` into two categories:
- **Even numbers** will go into slice `b`.
- **Odd numbers** will go into slice `c`.

#### **4. Printing the Even and Odd Slices:**
```go
fmt.Println(b)
fmt.Println(c)
```
- After the loop, it prints the contents of slices `b` and `c`:
  - `b` will contain the even numbers from `a`.
  - `c` will contain the odd numbers from `a`.

### **Step-by-Step Example:**

Starting with the slice `a = {1, 2, 3, 45}`:
- After appending `3`, `a` becomes `{1, 2, 3, 45, 3}`.
- After appending `123`, `a` becomes `{1, 2, 3, 45, 3, 123}`.
- The loop then processes each number:
  - `1` is odd → Added to `c`.
  - `2` is even → Added to `b`.
  - `3` is odd → Added to `c`.
  - `45` is odd → Added to `c`.
  - `3` is odd → Added to `c`.
  - `123` is odd → Added to `c`.

Thus:
- Slice `b` (even numbers) will contain: `{2}`.
- Slice `c` (odd numbers) will contain: `{1, 3, 45, 3, 123}`.

### **Final Output:**
```
45
[2]
[1 3 45 3 123]
```

#### **Key Points to Note:**
1. **Append operation:** `append` adds elements to a slice, and slices can dynamically grow as needed.
2. **Modulo operation (`%`):** The expression `a[i]%2 == 0` checks if the number is even by testing for a remainder of zero when divided by `2`.
3. **Looping through slices:** The `for` loop iterates over each element of the slice to perform a specific operation (in this case, separating even and odd numbers).
4. **Index-based access:** We use `a[3]` to print the value at index 3 of slice `a`.

### **Summary:**
This code:
- Creates and modifies a slice `a` by appending numbers.
- Separates the even and odd numbers from the slice into two new slices, `b` and `c`, using a loop and the modulo operator.
- Prints the even and odd numbers separately.
