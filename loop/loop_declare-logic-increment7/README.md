### Explanation of the Go Program

This Go program demonstrates the use of `for` loops with controlled delays using `time.Sleep`. The program runs two separate loops with different delays between iterations and prints the values of `number` and `number2`.

---

### 1. **First `for` Loop:**

```go
var number int = 0
for number <= 11 {
    fmt.Println("-->", number)
    number++
    time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)
}
```

#### **Initialization:**
- `var number int = 0` initializes an integer variable `number` with the value `0`.

#### **Loop Condition:**
- The loop runs while `number <= 11`. This means the loop will run as long as the value of `number` is less than or equal to `11`.

#### **Inside the Loop:**
- `fmt.Println("-->", number)` prints the value of `number` with a `-->` prefix to the console.
- `number++` increments the value of `number` by 1 after each iteration.
- `time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)` pauses the program for **1 second** between iterations. This is what causes the program to wait 1 second before continuing to the next iteration.

#### **Termination:**
- The loop continues to run until `number` exceeds `11`. The last value printed will be `number = 11`, and the next iteration will stop the loop since `number` will then be `12`, which doesn't satisfy the loop condition (`number <= 11`).

---

### 2. **Print Statement After First Loop:**

```go
fmt.Println("Next time ")
```

- After the first loop finishes, the program prints `"Next time "` to the console. This is just a separator between the two loops.

---

### 3. **Second `for` Loop:**

```go
var number2 int = 12
for number2 <= 20 {
    fmt.Println("-->", number2)
    number2++
    time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)
}
```

#### **Initialization:**
- `var number2 int = 12` initializes another integer variable `number2` with the value `12`.

#### **Loop Condition:**
- The loop will run while `number2 <= 20`. This means the loop will continue to execute until `number2` exceeds `20`.

#### **Inside the Loop:**
- `fmt.Println("-->", number2)` prints the value of `number2` with a `-->` prefix to the console.
- `number2++` increments the value of `number2` by 1 after each iteration.
- `time.Sleep(500 * time.Millisecond)` pauses the program for **500 milliseconds** (half a second) between iterations. This introduces a shorter delay compared to the first loop.

#### **Termination:**
- The loop will continue until `number2` exceeds `20`. The last value printed will be `number2 = 20`, and the next iteration will stop the loop since `number2` will become `21`, which does not satisfy the condition (`number2 <= 20`).

---

### 4. **Print Statement After Second Loop:**

```go
fmt.Println("Tugadi.")
```

- After the second loop finishes, the program prints `"Tugadi."` to the console. This signifies the end of the second loop.

---

### **Program Output Example:**

```
--> 0
--> 1
--> 2
--> 3
--> 4
--> 5
--> 6
--> 7
--> 8
--> 9
--> 10
--> 11
Next time 

--> 12
--> 13
--> 14
--> 15
--> 16
--> 17
--> 18
--> 19
--> 20
Tugadi.
```

- The program first prints values from `0` to `11` with a 1-second delay between each iteration.
- After that, it prints `"Next time "`.
- The program then prints values from `12` to `20` with a 500-millisecond delay between each iteration.
- After the second loop finishes, it prints `"Tugadi."`.

---

### **Key Points:**

1. **`time.Sleep()`**: The program uses `time.Sleep()` to introduce a delay between iterations of the loops. The first loop has a delay of 1 second (`time.Second`), and the second loop has a delay of 500 milliseconds (`time.Millisecond`).
   
2. **`for` Loop**: Both loops are simple `for` loops with a condition that determines how long the loop will continue.
   
3. **Incrementing Variables**: In both loops, the loop counter (`number` or `number2`) is incremented by 1 during each iteration (`number++` or `number2++`).

4. **Break between loops**: The string `"Next time "` acts as a separator between the first and second loop, making the output clearer.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This program demonstrates how to use `for` loops to iterate over a range of values and how to control the speed of execution with `time.Sleep()`. The first loop has a longer delay (1 second) compared to the second loop (500 milliseconds), which demonstrates different delay durations and how they affect the program's flow.
