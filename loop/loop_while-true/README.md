This Go code is designed to repeatedly prompt the user for a first name and a last name, format those names neatly, and print the formatted name. The program also provides a way for the user to exit the input loop by entering `'q'` at any time. Here's a detailed explanation of the rules and the structure of the code:

### Breakdown of the Code:

#### 1. **Importing Packages:**
```go
import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strings"
)
```
- **`bufio`**: This package is used to read input from the user, specifically with the `Scanner` type to get line-by-line input.
- **`fmt`**: This package is used for formatted I/O, such as printing output and scanning input.
- **`os`**: This package provides the `Stdin` object (standard input) to read input from the terminal.
- **`strings`**: This package provides functions for string manipulation. Here, it is used to capitalize (title-case) the formatted full name.

#### 2. **Function: `getFormattedName`**
```go
func getFormattedName(first string, last string, middle ...string) string {
	var fullName string
	if len(middle) > 0 {
		fullName = first + " " + middle[0] + " " + last
	} else {
		fullName = first + " " + last
	}
	return strings.Title(fullName)
}
```
- **Purpose**: This function takes in the `first`, `last`, and optionally, `middle` names (via `...string`, a variadic parameter that can take any number of strings).
- **Logic**:
  - If a middle name is provided (i.e., if the length of the `middle` slice is greater than 0), it formats the full name as `"first middle last"`.
  - If no middle name is provided, it formats the name as `"first last"`.
  - **`strings.Title(fullName)`**: This function capitalizes the first letter of each word in the `fullName` string, making it a neat, properly capitalized version of the name.

#### 3. **Main Program Logic:**
```go
func main() {
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)

	fmt.Println("Enter 'q' at any time to quit.")
	for {
		fmt.Print("\nPlease give me a first name: ")
		scanner.Scan()
		first := scanner.Text()
		if first == "q" {
			break
		}

		fmt.Print("Please give me a last name: ")
		scanner.Scan()
		last := scanner.Text()
		if last == "q" {
			break
		}

		formattedName := getFormattedName(first, last)
		fmt.Println("\tNeatly formatted name: " + formattedName + ".")
	}
}
```
- **Input Scanner**: 
  - **`scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)`**: Creates a new scanner to read input from the standard input (the terminal).
  
- **Input Loop**: 
  - The program enters an infinite loop (`for { ... }`) that repeatedly asks for user input.
  
  - **First Name**:
    - `fmt.Print("\nPlease give me a first name: ")`: Prompts the user to enter a first name.
    - **`scanner.Scan()`**: Reads the input line from the user.
    - **`first := scanner.Text()`**: Retrieves the text input from the scanner (the first name).
    - **`if first == "q" { break }`**: If the user enters `'q'`, the loop breaks and the program terminates.

  - **Last Name**:
    - Similarly, the program prompts the user for a last name and reads it using the same method.

  - **Formatting and Output**:
    - After receiving the first and last name, it calls the `getFormattedName(first, last)` function to get the neatly formatted name.
    - It then prints the formatted name using **`fmt.Println()`**.

- **Exiting the Program**:
  - The user can exit the loop and end the program by entering `'q'` for either the first name or the last name.

#### 4. **Sample Output**:

**Input**:
```
Please give me a first name: taya
Please give me a last name: naia
```

**Output**:
```
	Neatly formatted name: Taya Naia.
```

If the user enters `'q'` at any point:
```
Enter 'q' at any time to quit.

Please give me a first name: q
```

This exits the program gracefully.

### Key Concepts and Go Features:

1. **Scanner and Input Handling**:
   - `bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)` is used for reading user input, making it easier to handle line-by-line input.
   
2. **Variadic Function Parameters (`middle ...string`)**:
   - The `middle ...string` syntax allows the function to accept a variable number of middle name arguments. This makes the function flexible in handling names with or without a middle name.
   
3. **Control Flow with `if` Statements**:
   - The program uses `if` conditions to handle user input, specifically to check if the user enters `'q'` to quit the program.

4. **String Manipulation with `strings.Title()`**:
   - The `strings.Title()` function ensures that the full name is formatted with the first letter of each word capitalized.

5. **Looping with `for`**:
   - The `for` loop ensures that the program keeps running and asking for names until the user chooses to exit by typing `'q'`.

### Conclusion:
This Go program is an interactive name formatter. It uses a `for` loop for repeated user input, a variadic function to handle middle names, and string manipulation to format the full name neatly. The program also demonstrates graceful program termination via a user input check (`'q'` to quit).
