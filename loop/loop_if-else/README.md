### Explanation of the Code

The code you've shared is a simple **number guessing game**. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

#### **1. Initial Setup**
```go
number := 80
guess := 6
```
- **`number := 80`**: The **correct number** to guess is set to 80.
- **`guess := 6`**: The **initial guess** is set to 6. This value is arbitrary at the start since it will be updated based on user input.

#### **2. User Input**
```go
fmt.Scanln(&guess)
```
- This line asks the user to **enter their guess**. The `fmt.Scanln(&guess)` reads the input from the user and stores it in the `guess` variable.

#### **3. The `for` Loop (Main Game Loop)**
```go
for guess != number {
```
- This `for` loop continues running as long as the **guess is not equal to the correct number** (`number`).
- **Exit condition**: If the user guesses the correct number, the loop stops.

#### **4. Checking the Guess**
Inside the loop, there are two conditions to check:
- **If the guess is smaller than the correct number**:
  ```go
  if guess < number {
      fmt.Printf("Larger")
      fmt.Scanln(&guess)
  }
  ```
  - If the guess is smaller than the number, it prints `"Larger"`, and the program asks the user to guess a **larger number** by prompting them for input again with `fmt.Scanln(&guess)`.

- **If the guess is larger than the correct number**:
  ```go
  else if guess > number {
      fmt.Printf("Smaller")
      fmt.Scanln(&guess)
  }
  ```
  - If the guess is larger than the number, it prints `"Smaller"`, and the program asks the user to guess a **smaller number** by prompting them again.

#### **5. Correct Guess**
```go
fmt.Printf("You guessed it!")
```
- When the guess is equal to the correct number (`number`), the loop stops, and the message `"You guessed it!"` is printed to indicate that the user has successfully guessed the correct number.

### **Flow Example**

1. The correct number is 80, and the user's first guess is `6`.
   
   - The program checks if `6` is smaller or larger than `80`. Since `6` is smaller, it prints `"Larger"` and asks for a new guess.
   
2. The user enters their next guess, say `30`.

   - The program checks if `30` is smaller or larger than `80`. Since `30` is smaller, it prints `"Larger"` again and asks for another guess.

3. The user enters a guess, say `90`.

   - The program checks if `90` is smaller or larger than `80`. Since `90` is larger, it prints `"Smaller"` and asks for a new guess.

4. The user enters `80`.

   - The program checks if `80` is equal to `80`, which it is, so it exits the loop and prints `"You guessed it!"`.

---

### **Summary of Rules**:
- The program continually compares the user's guess to the correct number.
- It gives hints (`Larger` or `Smaller`) until the user guesses the correct number.
- The loop stops when the user guesses correctly, and a success message is displayed.

#### Possible Improvements:
- The code currently sets `guess := 6` initially, which is unnecessary because the user is immediately prompted to enter a guess. You can safely remove that line.

- You can also include a maximum number of attempts in the `for` loop to prevent the program from running indefinitely if the user is stuck.
