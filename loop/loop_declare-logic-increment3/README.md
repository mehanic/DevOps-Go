### Explanation of the Go Program

This Go program uses a **`for` loop** to print numbers from `0` to `100` by incrementing the value of `i` with each iteration. Let's break it down:

---

### 1. **Variable Initialization:**

```go
i := 0
```

- Here, the variable `i` is declared and initialized to `0`. This is the starting value for the loop counter, and it will be incremented on each iteration of the loop.

---

### 2. **The `for` Loop:**

```go
for i <= 100 {
    fmt.Println(" -->", i)
    i++
}
```

- This is a **`for` loop** that will continue running as long as the condition `i <= 100` is **true**. The loop checks if the value of `i` is less than or equal to `100`. If the condition is true, it proceeds to execute the body of the loop.

    - **Initialization**: `i := 0` happens before the loop starts. This sets `i` to 0.
    
    - **Condition**: `i <= 100` ensures the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 100. Once `i` becomes greater than 100, the loop terminates.
    
    - **Increment**: `i++` increments the value of `i` by 1 after each iteration, moving `i` from `0` to `100` in steps of 1. This is shorthand for `i = i + 1`.

---

### 3. **Printing the Value:**

```go
fmt.Println(" -->", i)
```

- Inside the loop body, the `fmt.Println(" -->", i)` line prints the current value of `i` along with the string `" -->"`. The `fmt.Println` function is used to output the value of `i` to the console.
  
  On the first iteration, it will print:

  ```
  --> 0
  ```

  Then, on the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to `1`, and it will print:

  ```
  --> 1
  ```

  This continues until `i` reaches `100`.

---

### 4. **Loop Termination:**

- When `i` becomes `101`, the condition `i <= 100` will no longer be true, and the loop will stop executing.

---

### **Final Output:**

The program will output the following sequence:

```
--> 0
--> 1
--> 2
--> 3
--> 4
--> 5
--> 6
--> 7
--> 8
--> 9
--> 10
...
--> 100
```

### **Key Points:**

1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `i = 0`.
2. **Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i <= 100`.
3. **Increment**: After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 (`i++`).
4. **Termination**: The loop stops when `i` becomes greater than `100`.
