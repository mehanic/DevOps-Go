### Explanation of the Go Program:

This Go program uses a **`for`** loop to iterate from `0` to `21` and prints each number during each iteration.

Let's break down the program step by step:

---

### 1. **The `for` Loop:**

```go
for num := 0; num < 22; num += 1 {
    fmt.Println(num)
}
```

This line contains the main **`for`** loop, which consists of three parts:

- **Initialization:** `num := 0`  
   This sets up the starting point of the loop. In this case, the loop will start with the value of `num` being `0`.

- **Condition:** `num < 22`  
   This is the condition that must be true for the loop to continue running. As long as `num` is less than `22`, the loop will keep executing. When `num` reaches `22`, the loop will stop. So, the loop will iterate 22 times, from `0` to `21`.

- **Increment:** `num += 1`  
   After each iteration, `num` is incremented by `1`. This means that in each loop iteration, the value of `num` will increase by 1. Initially, `num` is `0`, and after each loop, it will be `1`, `2`, `3`, and so on, until it reaches `21`.

---

### 2. **Print Statement:**

```go
fmt.Println(num)
```

This line is inside the loop and prints the current value of `num` in each iteration. So, the loop will print each value of `num` from `0` to `21`.

---

### **Flow of the Program:**

1. The loop starts with `num = 0` (initialization).
2. It checks if `num` is less than `22` (condition `num < 22`), which is true for the first iteration.
3. Inside the loop, it prints `0` (the current value of `num`).
4. The loop increments `num` by `1`, so now `num = 1`.
5. The loop checks if `num` is less than `22` again, which is still true, so it continues.
6. The loop prints the value of `num` and increments it by 1 after each iteration.
7. This continues until `num` reaches `21`. After the loop prints `21`, it increments `num` to `22`, which fails the condition `num < 22`.
8. The loop stops.

---

### **Output:**

The output of the program will be the numbers from `0` to `21`, each printed on a new line:

```
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20
21
```

---

### **Summary:**

- **`for` loop:** The program uses a `for` loop with an initialization (`num := 0`), condition (`num < 22`), and increment (`num += 1`).
- **Prints numbers from `0` to `21`:** The loop runs 22 times and prints the value of `num` each time, which ranges from `0` to `21`.
- **Stopping condition:** The loop stops when `num` reaches `22`, as the condition `num < 22` becomes false.
