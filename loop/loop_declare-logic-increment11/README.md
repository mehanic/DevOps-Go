### Explanation of the Go Program:

This Go program uses a **`for`** loop to print the message `"I am learning Go:"` followed by the numbers from `1` to `100`.

Let's break down the program step by step:

---

### 1. **The `for` Loop:**

```go
for i <= 100 {
    fmt.Println("I am learning Go:", i)
    i++
}
```

In this program, we're using a **`for`** loop with a **condition** (and no explicit initialization or increment) to print the message `"I am learning Go:"` followed by the value of `i`. Here's how it works:

#### Key Parts of the `for` Loop:

- **Initialization:** `i := 1`  
   The variable `i` is initialized to `1` outside the loop. This is the starting value of `i`.

- **Condition:** `i <= 100`  
   This is the condition that is checked before each iteration of the loop. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `100`. Once `i` exceeds `100`, the loop will stop.

- **Post Statement (Increment):** `i++`  
   Inside the loop, the value of `i` is incremented by `1` after each iteration. This ensures that the loop progresses from `1` to `100`. The `i++` shorthand is equivalent to `i = i + 1`.

### 2. **Print Statement:**

```go
fmt.Println("I am learning Go:", i)
```

- In each iteration of the loop, this line prints the message `"I am learning Go:"` followed by the current value of `i`.
- Initially, `i` starts at `1`, and after each loop iteration, `i` is incremented by `1` until it reaches `100`.
- Each time, the program prints a new line showing the message and the updated value of `i`.

---

### 3. **Flow of the Program:**

1. The program starts with `i = 1` (initialized before the loop).
2. The condition `i <= 100` is checked, and since `1 <= 100` is true, the loop runs.
3. Inside the loop, the program prints `"I am learning Go: 1"`.
4. The post statement `i++` increments `i` to `2`.
5. The loop checks the condition again. Since `i = 2` (which is still <= 100), the loop continues.
6. This process repeats, and `i` is incremented after each iteration. The message `"I am learning Go:"` will be printed with the corresponding value of `i` (2, 3, 4, ..., up to 100).
7. When `i` becomes `101`, the condition `i <= 100` becomes false, and the loop stops.

---

### **Output:**

The program will output the following sequence:

```
I am learning Go: 1
I am learning Go: 2
I am learning Go: 3
I am learning Go: 4
...
I am learning Go: 100
```

---

### **Summary:**

- **`for` loop without initialization and post statement:** In Go, a `for` loop can be used without the initialization and post statement parts. The condition is checked before each iteration, and inside the loop, you can manually increment the loop variable (`i++`).
- **Prints `"I am learning Go:"` followed by numbers from `1` to `100`:** The loop prints the message `"I am learning Go:"` and the value of `i` in each iteration.
- **Stopping condition:** The loop will stop when `i` exceeds `100`, because the condition `i <= 100` becomes false.
