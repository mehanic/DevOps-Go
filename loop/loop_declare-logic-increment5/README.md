### Explanation of the Go Program

This Go program demonstrates the use of **nested loops** to print a pattern of stars (`*`). Here's a breakdown of the code:

---

### 1. **Outer `for` Loop:**

```go
for i := 1; i <= 10; i++ {
```

- This `for` loop initializes the variable `i` to `1` and runs until `i` is less than or equal to `10` (`i <= 10`).
- On each iteration of the loop, `i` is incremented by `1` (`i++`).
  
  This loop will execute 10 times, once for each value of `i` from 1 to 10. Each time this loop runs, it will print a line of stars (`*`), as the **inner loop** (which prints the stars) will be executed each time.

---

### 2. **Inner `for` Loop:**

```go
for v := 1; v <= 10; v++ {
    fmt.Print("* ",)
}
```

- This inner loop initializes the variable `v` to `1` and runs until `v` is less than or equal to `10` (`v <= 10`).
- On each iteration of this inner loop, `v` is incremented by `1` (`v++`).
  
  This loop prints `* ` (a star followed by a space) each time it runs. It will run 10 times for each iteration of the outer loop. 

---

### 3. **Printing the Stars:**

```go
fmt.Print("* ",)
```

- This statement prints a star (`*`) followed by a space (` `) **on the same line** without adding a newline.
- The inner loop runs 10 times for each value of `i`, so it prints 10 stars on the same line.

---

### 4. **Line Break After Each Row:**

```go
fmt.Println()
```

- After the inner loop completes (i.e., 10 stars are printed in a row), the `fmt.Println()` statement adds a **line break** (new line).
- This ensures that after printing the 10 stars for each row, a new line starts for the next row of stars.

---

### **What the Code Does:**

- The outer loop iterates 10 times (from `1` to `10`).
- For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop iterates 10 times, printing a star (`*`) followed by a space on the same line.
- After 10 stars are printed for one row, the program moves to the next line, and the process repeats for 10 rows.

### **Output:**

The output will look like this:

```
* * * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * * 
* * * * * * * * * * 
```

### **Key Points:**

1. **Nested Loops**: The code uses a nested `for` loop where the **outer loop** controls the number of rows, and the **inner loop** controls the number of stars (`*`) printed per row.
2. **Printing without a Newline**: The `fmt.Print("* ")` statement in the inner loop prints a star on the same line.
3. **New Line After Each Row**: The `fmt.Println()` statement in the outer loop ensures that after each set of stars is printed, the cursor moves to the next line for the next row of stars.

---

### Conclusion:
This program is a simple demonstration of how **nested loops** can be used to print patterns in Go. The outer loop controls the number of rows, while the inner loop controls the number of stars printed in each row.
