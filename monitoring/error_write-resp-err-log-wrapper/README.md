The Go code you provided sets up an HTTP server with custom behavior for writing responses. It leverages the `http.ResponseWriter` interface and implements a `LogWriter` type to add logging functionality for outgoing responses. Let's break it down to explain how the program works and highlight some important rules and concepts.

### Code Breakdown:

1. **LogWriter Type:**
   ```go
   type LogWriter struct {
       http.ResponseWriter
   }
   ```
   - `LogWriter` is a custom struct that embeds `http.ResponseWriter`.
   - The `http.ResponseWriter` is an interface that allows the HTTP server to send responses to the client. By embedding it in `LogWriter`, you can extend or customize the behavior of `http.ResponseWriter`.
   - This custom writer is used to log any errors encountered while writing the response.

2. **Custom `Write` Method for `LogWriter`:**
   ```go
   func (w LogWriter) Write(p []byte) {
       _, err := w.ResponseWriter.Write(p)
       if err != nil {
           log.Println("cannot write response: " + err.Error())
       }
   }
   ```
   - This method overrides the `Write` method that `http.ResponseWriter` provides.
   - It writes the response body (`p` is the byte slice containing the response data) using the `Write` method of the embedded `ResponseWriter`.
   - If there is an error during writing, it logs the error using `log.Println`.
   - By using this `LogWriter`, every response will be logged if thereâ€™s an issue with writing the response, allowing you to handle errors in one place.

3. **HTTP Handlers:**
   The code sets up several HTTP handler functions, each corresponding to different paths. Each handler uses `LogWriter` to write the response and potentially logs any errors that occur during the writing of the response.

   ### `/hijack-err` Handler:
   ```go
   http.HandleFunc("/hijack-err", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       hj, ok := w.(http.Hijacker)
       if !ok {
           http.Error(w, "no hijacking support", http.StatusInternalServerError)
           return
       }

       conn, _, err := hj.Hijack()
       if err != nil {
           http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
           return
       }
       defer conn.Close()

       w.Header().Set("content-type", "application/json")
       LogWriter{w}.Write([]byte(`{"msg": "OK"}`))
   })
   ```
   - This handler attempts to "hijack" the connection, which is typically used to upgrade the connection to something like a WebSocket.
   - If hijacking is not supported, it returns an HTTP 500 error.
   - If hijacking is successful, the response is written using the custom `LogWriter`.
   - **Hijacking** allows taking over the connection to read or write raw data, which can be useful for protocols like WebSockets. If the hijack fails, an error message is returned.

   ### `/body-not-allowed-err` Handler:
   ```go
   http.HandleFunc("/body-not-allowed-err", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       w.WriteHeader(http.StatusNoContent)
       w.Header().Set("content-type", "application/json")
       LogWriter{w}.Write([]byte(`{"msg": "OK"}`))
   })
   ```
   - This handler sends a `204 No Content` status, indicating that the server successfully processed the request, but there is no content to return.
   - Despite that, it still tries to write a body (`{"msg": "OK"}`), which is invalid because the `204 No Content` response should not have a body.
   - This could result in an HTTP error, and any error in writing the response would be logged.

   ### `/content-length-err` Handler:
   ```go
   http.HandleFunc("/content-length-err", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       w.Header().Set("content-type", "application/json")
       w.Header().Set("content-length", "1")
       LogWriter{w}.Write([]byte(`{"msg": "OK"}`))
   })
   ```
   - This handler sets an incorrect `Content-Length` header (the length is set to 1 byte, but the actual body is longer).
   - Setting the `Content-Length` header incorrectly might cause issues when the client tries to read the response, as the body size doesn't match the declared length.
   - Any issue in writing the response would be caught and logged.

   ### `/` Handler (Default):
   ```go
   http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
       w.Header().Set("content-type", "application/json")
       LogWriter{w}.Write([]byte(`{"msg": "OK"}`))
   })
   ```
   - This is the default handler for all other requests.
   - It simply sets the `Content-Type` header to `application/json` and writes a response with the body `{"msg": "OK"}` using the custom `LogWriter`.
   - This is the simplest case, where no errors are expected, but it still uses `LogWriter` for logging purposes.

4. **Starting the Server:**
   ```go
   if err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", http.DefaultServeMux); err != nil {
       log.Fatal(err)
   }
   ```
   - This starts the HTTP server on port `8080` using the default `http.ServeMux` (which was set up with the handler functions).
   - If there is any error while starting the server (e.g., if the port is already in use), it logs the error and stops execution.

### `writeOK` Function (Unused):
```go
func writeOK(w http.ResponseWriter) { //nolint:deadcode,unused
    _, _ = w.Write([]byte(`{"msg": "OK"}`))
}
```
- This function is defined but not used anywhere in the code.
- It simply writes the `{"msg": "OK"}` response. The `nolint` directive suggests that this unused code should be ignored by the linter.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Custom `ResponseWriter` (`LogWriter`)**:
   - By embedding `http.ResponseWriter` in a custom struct, you can extend or modify its behavior. In this case, `LogWriter` logs any errors encountered while writing the response.
   
2. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - If writing the response body fails (e.g., due to an incorrect header or a network issue), the error is logged by `LogWriter`. This ensures that any issues with sending responses are captured for debugging.

3. **HTTP Handlers**:
   - Each route (e.g., `/hijack-err`, `/content-length-err`) handles different scenarios and errors that might occur during an HTTP request. Each handler uses `LogWriter` to write responses and log any issues.
   
4. **Hijacking Connections**:
   - The `/hijack-err` route demonstrates how to hijack an HTTP connection, which is typically used for upgrading protocols (e.g., WebSockets).

### Conclusion:
This code demonstrates advanced usage of HTTP handling, custom response writers, and error logging. The `LogWriter` is a custom wrapper around `http.ResponseWriter` that adds error logging functionality. The program covers a variety of HTTP-related scenarios, including hijacking connections, handling HTTP status codes like `204 No Content`, and writing responses with potentially mismatched headers, all while logging any errors encountered during the process.
