This Go program demonstrates the usage of the `emperror` package along with the `logrus` logger for structured error handling and logging. It shows how to create a custom error, add additional details to it, and handle it using a logging handler.

Let's break down the code and explain how it works:

### Key Components:
1. **`errors.New`**: 
   - This is a standard Go function used to create a basic error message. It creates a new error with the specified message.

2. **`emperror.dev/errors`**:
   - The `emperror` package provides utilities for enriching and handling errors. 
   - The key functionality here is `WithDetails`, which allows adding extra contextual information to an error (in this case, "userID" and "requestID").
   - `WithDetails` attaches additional information to the error without modifying the original error.

3. **`logrus`**:
   - Logrus is a structured logger for Go (often used in production systems). It allows structured logging, which means that logs can be enriched with extra fields, which makes it easier to analyze them later.
   - In this code, a new logger is created, and errors are logged using the `logrus` logging handler.

4. **`logrushandler.New`**:
   - This is a handler from the `logrus` package that integrates the `emperror` error handling with Logrus. 
   - Itâ€™s used to output errors to the `logrus` logger.

### Code Walkthrough:

```go
func main() {
    logger := logrus.New() // Create a new logrus logger
    handler := logrushandler.New(logger) // Create a new error handler that uses the logrus logger
```

- **Logger Setup**: 
  - The `logrus.New()` function creates a new instance of a `logrus` logger. This logger will be used for structured logging, meaning that any error handled will be logged with additional details (like log levels, timestamps, etc.).

- **Handler Setup**: 
  - `logrushandler.New(logger)` creates a new handler that will use the `logger` to log any errors handled by it.

```go
    err := errors.New("an error") // Create a simple error using the standard library
    handler.Handle(err) // Handle the error and log it using the logrus handler
```

- **Creating a Basic Error**: 
  - `errors.New("an error")` creates a basic error with the message `"an error"`. This error is passed to the handler using `handler.Handle(err)`, which will log the error using the `logrus` logger.
  - **Default Logging**: Since this is a simple error, `logrus` will log it with its default behavior.

```go
    err2 := emperrors.WithDetails(err, "userID", 3587, "requestID", "4cfdc2e157eefe6facb983b1d557b3a1")
    handler.Handle(err2)
}
```

- **Creating an Error with Details**:
  - `emperrors.WithDetails` is used to add more context to the error. The error `err` is enhanced with two additional fields: `"userID"` with the value `3587`, and `"requestID"` with a specific request ID.
  - This enhanced error (`err2`) is then passed to the same handler using `handler.Handle(err2)`.
  - The handler will log the enhanced error, which includes the extra details (`userID`, `requestID`).

### Logging Output:
When the handler processes the errors, it will log them using `logrus`. The first error is logged in its original form, and the second error, which includes additional context, will be logged with the extra fields.

### Expected Log Output:
For the first error (`err`):

```
time="2025-03-22T00:00:00Z" level=error msg="an error"
```

For the second error (`err2` with additional details):

```
time="2025-03-22T00:00:01Z" level=error msg="an error" userID=3587 requestID="4cfdc2e157eefe6facb983b1d557b3a1"
```

### Key Concepts:
1. **Error Handling with `emperror`**:
   - The `emperror` package extends the basic error handling capabilities by allowing you to enrich errors with additional context (`WithDetails`).
   - This makes it easier to track errors with more metadata, such as user IDs, request IDs, etc., which are very useful for debugging, monitoring, and tracing in production systems.

2. **Structured Logging with `logrus`**:
   - `logrus` is a powerful structured logger that provides various log levels (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`) and supports adding fields to log entries.
   - In this case, the logger is used to log errors in a structured format, which will make the logs more informative and easier to analyze.

3. **Error Handler Integration**:
   - By using `logrushandler.New`, you are linking the `emperror` error handling system with `logrus`'s logging capabilities. This way, every time an error is handled, it gets logged in the format provided by `logrus`.

4. **Error Enhancement**:
   - `WithDetails` is a function in the `emperror` package that allows you to attach arbitrary metadata to errors. This is useful in a production environment, where you might want to add user-specific or request-specific data to errors for easier troubleshooting.

### Practical Use Case:
In a production environment, adding additional context (like `userID`, `requestID`, or other metadata) to errors is crucial. For example:
- You might be handling HTTP requests, and you want to log the user ID or the request ID along with the error to easily track which user or request encountered an issue.
- Structured logging (with loggers like `logrus`) helps in organizing logs in a format that is machine-readable, making it easier to aggregate logs for analysis or monitor errors over time.

This approach of enriching and logging errors is commonly used in large-scale applications to improve error tracking, monitoring, and debugging.
