This Go program demonstrates how the `byte` type works and shows the binary and decimal representation of the minimum and maximum values a `byte` can hold.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Byte**: In Go, `byte` is an alias for the `uint8` type, meaning it is an unsigned integer type with a size of 8 bits (1 byte). A `byte` can represent values from `0` to `255` (inclusive).

2. **Binary Representation**: Binary numbers are represented using base-2 digits (0 and 1). In an 8-bit representation, each bit can be either `0` or `1`, and the full 8 bits together represent an integer.

3. **Decimal Representation**: The decimal representation is the familiar number system (base-10), where numbers are expressed with digits 0-9.

### Code Walkthrough:

#### 1. **Initialization of the `byte` variable `b`**:
```go
var b byte
```
Here, a variable `b` of type `byte` (which is an alias for `uint8`) is declared.

#### 2. **Setting `b` to `0`** (minimum value):
```go
b = 0
fmt.Printf("%08b = %d\n", b, b)
```
- **Binary Representation**: `b = 0` represents all bits as `0`. In an 8-bit binary system, it looks like `00000000`. The `%08b` format specifier ensures the output is always 8 digits, even if there are leading zeros.
  - **Binary Output**: `00000000`
  
- **Decimal Representation**: The decimal representation of `b = 0` is `0`. The `%d` format specifier prints the decimal value.
  - **Decimal Output**: `0`

Thus, the first output is:
```
00000000 = 0
```

#### 3. **Setting `b` to `255`** (maximum value):
```go
b = 255
fmt.Printf("%08b = %d\n", b, b)
```
- **Binary Representation**: `b = 255` represents all bits as `1`. In an 8-bit binary system, it looks like `11111111`. The `%08b` ensures 8 digits, even though there are no leading zeros.
  - **Binary Output**: `11111111`

- **Decimal Representation**: The decimal representation of `b = 255` is `255`. This is because the binary value `11111111` in decimal is equal to `255`.
  - **Decimal Output**: `255`

Thus, the second output is:
```
11111111 = 255
```

### Summary:
- The `byte` type in Go is an unsigned 8-bit integer (0 to 255).
- The `fmt.Printf` function with the `%08b` format specifier prints the 8-bit binary representation of the number, and `%d` prints its decimal value.
- The minimum value of a `byte` is `0` (`00000000` in binary), and the maximum value is `255` (`11111111` in binary).

### Final Output:
```
00000000 = 0
11111111 = 255
```
