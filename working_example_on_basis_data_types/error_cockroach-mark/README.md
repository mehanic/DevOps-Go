This Go program demonstrates how to use the `errors` package from CockroachDB to mark and wrap errors. It also shows how to use `errors.Is` to check if an error matches a certain type or value, even when the error has been wrapped or marked with additional context. Let's break down each part of the code and explain the rules behind it:

### **1. Initial Error Assignment**

```go
err := io.ErrUnexpectedEOF
```

- This creates an error `err` and assigns it the value `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`, which is a predefined error from the `io` package that typically indicates an unexpected end of file condition.

### **2. Marking the Error**

```go
err = errors.Mark(err, io.EOF) // Помечаем ошибку как io.EOF.
```

- The `errors.Mark` function is used here to **mark** the error `err` with `io.EOF`. Marking an error means that you're attaching additional context to it, which allows you to track that this error is related to the specific error `io.EOF`.
  
- After this line, the error `err` is both of type `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF` and also **marked** with `io.EOF`. Marking an error is useful because it allows you to perform more flexible error matching later, even if the error has been wrapped or transformed.

### **3. Wrapping the Error**

```go
err = errors.Wrap(err, "something other happened")
```

- The `errors.Wrap` function is used to **wrap** the error `err` with additional context: `"something other happened"`.
  
- **Wrapping an error** means creating a new error that contains the original error (`err` in this case) along with some extra descriptive message. Wrapping an error is helpful when you want to provide more information about the context in which the error occurred.

- Now, `err` is both:
  - Marked with `io.EOF`
  - Wrapped with the message `"something other happened"`
  - Still contains the original error `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`

### **4. Checking if the Error is `io.EOF`**

```go
if errors.Is(err, io.EOF) { // true
    fmt.Println("error is io.EOF")
}
```

- The `errors.Is` function is used to check if `err` matches the `io.EOF` error (or is marked with it).
  
- **How `errors.Is` works:**
  - When you use `errors.Is`, it checks whether the error you're checking (`err`) is either the same as, or wrapped by, the target error (`io.EOF`).
  - Since `err` was marked with `io.EOF`, `errors.Is` will return `true`, even though the error itself is actually `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`.

- As a result, the program prints `"error is io.EOF"`.

### **5. Checking if the Error is `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`**

```go
if errors.Is(err, io.ErrUnexpectedEOF) { // true
    fmt.Println("error is io.ErrUnexpectedEOF")
}
```

- Next, `errors.Is` is used again to check if `err` is of type `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`.
  
- This check returns `true` because:
  - The error `err` was initially set to `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`.
  - The error was wrapped, but `errors.Is` still correctly matches the original error type (`io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`) even after wrapping.

- As a result, the program prints `"error is io.ErrUnexpectedEOF"`.

### **Summary of the Key Rules and Concepts**

1. **Error Marking (`errors.Mark`)**:
   - Marking an error adds additional context to it, making it possible to associate the error with another error type (e.g., `io.EOF`).
   - Even if the error is wrapped, `errors.Is` can match it based on the marked error.

2. **Error Wrapping (`errors.Wrap`)**:
   - Wrapping an error means adding more context or information while preserving the original error.
   - You can wrap errors multiple times to build a chain of contextual information.

3. **`errors.Is` for Error Matching**:
   - `errors.Is` can be used to check if an error matches a particular target error type, even if that error has been wrapped or marked with additional context.
   - It works by checking if the error is the same as or if it is wrapped by the target error.
   - In this case, even though the error is wrapped and marked, `errors.Is` correctly matches `io.EOF` and `io.ErrUnexpectedEOF`.

### **Final Output**

The output of this program is:

```
error is io.EOF
error is io.ErrUnexpectedEOF
```

### **Conclusion**

- **Marking** errors helps associate them with other specific error types, which can later be checked using `errors.Is`.
- **Wrapping** errors allows you to add context to an error while still retaining the original error information.
- `errors.Is` checks if an error or any error in its chain matches a specific error type, regardless of whether it has been wrapped or marked with additional errors.
