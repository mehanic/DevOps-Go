This Go program demonstrates how to use **type aliases** and **type conversions** to work with units of temperature, such as **Celsius** and **Fahrenheit**. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### **1. Defining Type Aliases:**
```go
type (
    Temperature float64
    Celsius     Temperature
    Fahrenheit  Temperature
)
```
- The `type` keyword in Go is used to create **type aliases** (or custom types).
- `Temperature` is defined as an alias for `float64`, meaning `Temperature` is just another name for the `float64` type.
- `Celsius` and `Fahrenheit` are then created as aliases for `Temperature`, meaning they both represent `float64` but semantically represent different types of temperature. This allows for more readable and meaningful code.

### **2. Declaring Variables:**
```go
var (
    celsius       Celsius     = 15.5
    fahr          Fahrenheit  = 59.9
    celsiusDegree Temperature = 10.5
    fahrDegree    Temperature = 2.5
    factor                    = 2.
)
```
- **`celsius`** is of type `Celsius` and is initialized with the value `15.5`.
- **`fahr`** is of type `Fahrenheit` and is initialized with the value `59.9`.
- **`celsiusDegree`** and **`fahrDegree`** are variables of type `Temperature`, initialized with the values `10.5` and `2.5`, respectively.
- **`factor`** is a `float64` constant with the value `2.0`.

### **3. Modifying Variables Using Type Conversions:**
```go
celsius *= Celsius(float64(celsiusDegree) * factor)
fahr *= Fahrenheit(float64(fahrDegree) * factor)
```
Here, the program modifies the `celsius` and `fahr` variables using a combination of multiplication and **type conversions**.

#### **celsius modification:**
- `celsiusDegree` is a `Temperature` type, and to perform arithmetic with `float64` (which `celsius` is), it is first converted to `float64` using `float64(celsiusDegree)`.
- This value (`10.5`) is then multiplied by `factor` (`2.0`), resulting in `21.0`.
- The result (`21.0`) is converted to `Celsius` using `Celsius()`, and then the `celsius` variable is multiplied by this result.
- **Effect:** The value of `celsius` becomes `15.5 * 21.0 = 325.5`.

#### **fahr modification:**
- Similarly, `fahrDegree` is converted from `Temperature` to `float64` using `float64(fahrDegree)`, resulting in `2.5`.
- This value is multiplied by `factor` (`2.0`), resulting in `5.0`.
- The result (`5.0`) is then converted to `Fahrenheit` using `Fahrenheit()`, and the `fahr` variable is multiplied by this result.
- **Effect:** The value of `fahr` becomes `59.9 * 5.0 = 299.5`.

### **4. Printing the Results:**
```go
fmt.Println(celsius, fahr)
```
- Finally, the modified values of `celsius` and `fahr` are printed.
- After the calculations, the values of `celsius` and `fahr` are `325.5` and `299.5`, respectively.

### **Summary of the Program:**
- **Type Aliases**: `Celsius`, `Fahrenheit`, and `Temperature` are all aliases of `float64`. These allow you to semantically differentiate between different types of temperature while still using the `float64` underlying type.
- **Type Conversion**: The program uses type conversions to change between the `Temperature` type (which is just `float64`) and the `Celsius` and `Fahrenheit` types. This helps ensure that arithmetic operations are performed on the correct type and unit.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: The `celsius` and `fahr` variables are modified by multiplying them with converted values derived from `celsiusDegree` and `fahrDegree`, respectively.

### **Output:**
If you run the program, the output will be:
```
325.5 299.5
```

### **Key Takeaways:**
1. **Type Aliases** in Go are useful for creating meaningful names for types, even when those types are technically the same underlying type (`float64` in this case).
2. **Type Conversion** is necessary when you need to perform operations between different types (like `Celsius` and `Temperature`). It ensures that you are operating with the correct type.
3. **Arithmetic Operations** can be performed after ensuring that all types match or are properly converted.
