This Go program demonstrates the use of some functions from the `math` and `math/big` packages, as well as implementing a memoized recursive function to compute Fibonacci numbers using `big.Int` for handling large numbers. Let's break it down:

### 1. **The `Examples` Function:**
The `Examples` function demonstrates a few functions from the `math` package and prints some mathematical constants. 

```go
func Examples() {
	// sqrt Example
	i := 25
	result := math.Sqrt(float64(i))
	fmt.Println(result)

	// ceil rounds up
	result = math.Ceil(9.5)
	fmt.Println(result)

	// floor rounds down
	result = math.Floor(9.5)
	fmt.Println(result)

	// math also stores some consts:
	fmt.Println("Pi:", math.Pi, "E:", math.E)
}
```

#### Inside `Examples`:

- **`math.Sqrt(float64(i))`**:
  - `math.Sqrt` computes the square root of a number. Since `i` is an integer, it's first converted to a `float64` type because `math.Sqrt` works with `float64`. The result for `i = 25` will be `5`, as `√25 = 5`.

- **`math.Ceil(9.5)`**:
  - `math.Ceil` rounds the given number *up* to the nearest integer. The result for `9.5` is `10.0`.

- **`math.Floor(9.5)`**:
  - `math.Floor` rounds the given number *down* to the nearest integer. The result for `9.5` is `9.0`.

- **`math.Pi` and `math.E`**:
  - `math.Pi` is a constant representing the mathematical constant π (pi), and `math.E` represents Euler's number (approximately 2.718). The values are printed in the `Examples` function.

The output of `Examples` will be:
```
5
10
9
Pi: 3.141592653589793 E: 2.718281828459045
```

### 2. **The `Fib` Function:**
This function calculates Fibonacci numbers using memoization to optimize performance. 

#### The Fibonacci Sequence:
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Starting from 0 and 1, the sequence looks like this: `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...`.

In this implementation, `Fib` is a recursive function that calculates the `n`-th Fibonacci number. Memoization is used to avoid recalculating the same Fibonacci number multiple times.

```go
var memoize map[int]*big.Int

func init() {
	// initialize the map
	memoize = make(map[int]*big.Int)
}
```

- **`memoize`**: This global variable is a map (`map[int]*big.Int`) used to store the results of Fibonacci calculations for reuse. The key is the Fibonacci number's index `n`, and the value is the `big.Int` representing the Fibonacci number at that index.

#### `Fib` Function:

```go
func Fib(n int) *big.Int {
	if n < 0 {
		return big.NewInt(1)  // Return 1 for any negative input.
	}

	// Base case
	if n < 2 {
		memoize[n] = big.NewInt(1)
	}

	// Check if the Fibonacci number is already memoized
	if val, ok := memoize[n]; ok {
		return val
	}

	// Calculate and memoize the Fibonacci number
	memoize[n] = big.NewInt(0)
	memoize[n].Add(memoize[n], Fib(n-1))
	memoize[n].Add(memoize[n], Fib(n-2))

	// Return the result
	return memoize[n]
}
```

#### Explanation of the Fibonacci function:

1. **Base Case**:
   - The base case of the Fibonacci sequence is `Fib(0) = 1` and `Fib(1) = 1`. This is handled by the `if n < 2` block.
   - When `n` is less than 2, it assigns `1` to the `memoize` map for `n` and returns `1`.

2. **Memoization**:
   - Before performing the Fibonacci calculation, the function checks if the value for the `n`-th Fibonacci number has already been calculated and stored in the `memoize` map. If it has, it simply returns the precomputed value.
   
3. **Recursive Calculation**:
   - If the Fibonacci number hasn't been memoized yet, the function recursively calculates `Fib(n-1)` and `Fib(n-2)` and adds them to get the `n`-th Fibonacci number. The result is stored in the `memoize` map for future use.

4. **Return**:
   - The calculated (or memoized) Fibonacci number is returned as a `*big.Int` (to handle large numbers that might exceed the limits of the standard integer types like `int64`).

---

### 3. **Memoization and `big.Int` Usage**:
- **Memoization** is a technique used to store the results of expensive function calls (in this case, the Fibonacci numbers) and reuse them when the same calculations are needed again. This significantly reduces the computational time by avoiding repetitive calculations.
  
- **`big.Int`**: The Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so the values can quickly become very large. The `int64` type isn't sufficient to handle these large numbers, so the `math/big` package is used, specifically the `big.Int` type, which can store arbitrarily large integers.

---

### 4. **Fibonacci Sequence Output**:
The main part of the program prints the first 10 Fibonacci numbers:
```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
	fmt.Printf("%v ", Fib(i))
}
fmt.Println()
```

The output will be:
```
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55
```
These are the first 10 Fibonacci numbers, starting from `Fib(0) = 1`.

---

### Summary:
- **Examples** demonstrates basic mathematical functions from the `math` package, such as square root, ceiling, and floor, as well as constants like Pi and Euler's number.
- **Fib** implements a recursive Fibonacci function with memoization and uses the `math/big` package to handle large numbers.
- **Memoization** improves performance by storing previously computed Fibonacci numbers in a map, avoiding redundant calculations.
- **big.Int** is used to ensure that even large Fibonacci numbers can be computed and stored correctly.

The program efficiently computes Fibonacci numbers while handling large values using memoization and the `big.Int` type.
