This Go program demonstrates basic data types, implicit typing, and variable declarations. Let's go through the code step-by-step and explain each part.

### 1. **Integer Types:**
   The program begins by demonstrating different integer types in Go.

   ```go
   var a int8 = -1   // int8: Signed 8-bit integer. Range: -128 to 127.
   var b int16 = -4  // int16: Signed 16-bit integer. Range: -32,768 to 32,767.
   var c int32 = -6  // int32: Signed 32-bit integer. Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
   var d int64 = -9  // int64: Signed 64-bit integer. Range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
   var e uint8 = 2   // uint8: Unsigned 8-bit integer. Range: 0 to 255.
   var f uint16 = 5  // uint16: Unsigned 16-bit integer. Range: 0 to 65,535.
   var g uint32 = 8  // uint32: Unsigned 32-bit integer. Range: 0 to 4,294,967,295.
   var h uint64 = 10 // uint64: Unsigned 64-bit integer. Range: 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.
   ```

   - **`int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`** represent signed integers of various sizes (1, 2, 4, and 8 bytes respectively).
   - **`uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`** represent unsigned integers of the same sizes.
   - **`byte`** is an alias for `uint8` and is often used to represent raw data (like characters).
   - **`rune`** is an alias for `int32`, commonly used to represent Unicode code points (characters).

   Each type's **range** (the set of values it can represent) is specified in the comments.

   Output:
   ```bash
   var a int8 =  -1
   var b int16 =  -4
   var c int32 =  -6
   var d int64 =  -9
   var e uint8 =  2
   var f uint16 =  5
   var g uint32 =  8
   var h uint64 =  10
   var i byte =  3
   var j rune =  -7
   var k int =  102
   var m uint =  105
   ```

### 2. **Floating Point Numbers:**
   The program demonstrates the use of floating-point numbers.

   ```go
   var f1 float32 = 18    // float32: 32-bit floating point.
   var g1 float32 = 4.5
   var d1 float64 = 0.23  // float64: 64-bit floating point.
   var pi float64 = 3.14
   var e1 float64 = 2.7
   ```

   - **`float32`** represents a floating-point number with 32 bits of precision.
   - **`float64`** represents a floating-point number with 64 bits of precision and is the default floating-point type in Go.

   Output:
   ```bash
   var f float32 =  18
   var g float32 =  4.5
   var d float64 =  0.23
   var pi float64 =  3.14
   var e float64 =  2.7
   ```

### 3. **Complex Numbers:**
   The program introduces complex numbers.

   ```go
   var f2 complex64 = 1 + 2i  // complex64: Complex number with float32 real and imaginary parts.
   var g2 complex128 = 4 + 3i // complex128: Complex number with float64 real and imaginary parts.
   ```

   - **`complex64`** represents a complex number where both the real and imaginary parts are of type `float32`.
   - **`complex128`** represents a complex number where both the real and imaginary parts are of type `float64`.

   Output:
   ```bash
   var f2 complex64 =  (1+2i)
   var g2 complex128 =  (4+3i)
   ```

### 4. **Boolean Type:**
   The program shows how to define boolean variables.

   ```go
   var isAlive bool = true    // bool: Logical type, can be either true or false.
   var isEnabled bool = false // bool: Logical type, can be either true or false.
   ```

   - **`bool`** represents a logical type with two possible values: `true` or `false`.

   Output:
   ```bash
   var isAlive bool =  true
   var isEnabled bool =  false
   ```

### 5. **Strings:**
   The program demonstrates how to define string variables.

   ```go
   var name string = "Том Сойер" // string: Sequence of characters (UTF-8 encoded).
   ```

   - **`string`** represents a sequence of characters. In Go, strings are UTF-8 encoded.

   Output:
   ```bash
   var name string =  Том Сойер
   ```

### 6. **Implicit Type Inference:**
   The program explains Go's ability to infer types implicitly when a variable is initialized.

   ```go
   var name1, age = "Dmitrii", 45
   fmt.Println(fmt.Sprintf("My name is %s. And I'm %d years old", name1, age))
   ```

   - In this case, the type of `name1` is inferred as `string` because it's initialized with a string, and `age` is inferred as `int` because it's initialized with an integer.
   - This is an example of **implicit type inference** where the Go compiler automatically determines the type based on the assigned value.

   Output:
   ```bash
   My name is Dmitrii. And I'm 45 years old
   ```

### 7. **Rules for Implicit Typing:**
   - You can skip specifying the type if you initialize a variable with a value. The Go compiler will automatically infer the type based on the value:
     ```go
     var name = "Tom"  // Inferred type: string
     var age = 27      // Inferred type: int
     ```

   - If you want to declare a variable without a value, you must specify its type:
     ```go
     var name string  // This works without a value, but we must specify the type.
     ```

   - If a variable is declared without both a type and an initial value, it will result in a **compilation error**:
     ```go
     var name  // Error: missing type or value
     ```

### Summary:
- **Go has several built-in types**, including integer types (`int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`), unsigned integers (`uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`), floating-point types (`float32`, `float64`), complex numbers (`complex64`, `complex128`), `bool`, and `string`.
- **Implicit type inference** allows Go to automatically determine the type of a variable based on the assigned value, which simplifies variable declarations.
- **Type aliasing** (like `byte` for `uint8` and `rune` for `int32`) helps make the code more readable and semantically meaningful.
