This Go program demonstrates the usage of constants from the **`math`** package related to the **minimum and maximum floating-point values** for both `float32` and `float64` types. It uses **`math.SmallestNonzeroFloat32`**, **`math.MaxFloat32`**, **`math.SmallestNonzeroFloat64`**, and **`math.MaxFloat64`** constants. Let's break down the program and explain each part:

### **1. Importing the `math` package**
```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)
```
- The `fmt` package is used for formatting and printing to the standard output.
- The `math` package provides constants and functions for mathematical operations.

### **2. Printing the minimum and maximum float64 values**
```go
fmt.Printf("min float64: %.50e\n", math.SmallestNonzeroFloat64)
fmt.Printf("max float64: %.50e\n", math.MaxFloat64)
```
- **`math.SmallestNonzeroFloat64`** represents the smallest **positive non-zero** value for a `float64` (double-precision floating-point) in Go.
  - This constant is the smallest `float64` that is not equal to zero (i.e., it is the smallest positive subnormal number).
  - In Go, `float64` is a double-precision floating-point number, and the smallest positive non-zero number represents the smallest subnormal number, which is extremely small.
  
- **`math.MaxFloat64`** represents the largest possible value for a `float64` (double-precision floating-point) in Go.
  - This constant is the largest value that can be represented by a `float64` (i.e., the largest finite number in `float64` format).

The format specifier `%.50e` is used to print the numbers in **scientific notation** with 50 decimal places of precision.

Example output:
```bash
min float64: 5.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e-324
max float64: 1.79769313486231570814527423731704356798300000000000000e+308
```

- The **smallest positive non-zero value** for `float64` is extremely small (close to zero), denoted as `5e-324`.
- The **largest possible value** for `float64` is very large, approximately `1.7977e+308`.

### **3. Printing the minimum and maximum float32 values**
```go
fmt.Printf("min float32: %.50e\n", math.SmallestNonzeroFloat32)
fmt.Printf("max float32: %.50e\n", math.MaxFloat32)
```
- **`math.SmallestNonzeroFloat32`** represents the smallest **positive non-zero** value for a `float32` (single-precision floating-point) in Go.
  - This constant is the smallest `float32` that is not equal to zero, and it is the smallest subnormal number in the `float32` format.
  
- **`math.MaxFloat32`** represents the largest possible value for a `float32` (single-precision floating-point) in Go.
  - This constant is the largest value that can be represented by a `float32` (i.e., the largest finite number in `float32` format).

As with `float64`, the format specifier `%.50e` is used to print the numbers in **scientific notation** with 50 decimal places of precision.

Example output:
```bash
min float32: 1.401298464324817070923729583289916131280002922332e-45
max float32: 3.402823466385288598117041555032935220459e+38
```

- The **smallest positive non-zero value** for `float32` is very small (`1.4013e-45`).
- The **largest possible value** for `float32` is approximately `3.4028e+38`.

### **Key Points:**
- **`math.SmallestNonzeroFloat64`** and **`math.SmallestNonzeroFloat32`** represent the smallest positive non-zero values for `float64` and `float32`, respectively. These are **subnormal numbers**, which are extremely small values close to zero.
- **`math.MaxFloat64`** and **`math.MaxFloat32`** represent the largest finite values that can be represented by `float64` and `float32`, respectively.
- The **scientific notation** (`%.50e`) is used to display these very large and very small values with high precision, allowing you to see all the significant digits.
- **`float64`** offers much higher precision and a wider range of values compared to **`float32`**.

### **Example Output:**
```bash
min float64: 5.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e-324
max float64: 1.79769313486231570814527423731704356798300000000000000e+308
min float32: 1.401298464324817070923729583289916131280002922332e-45
max float32: 3.402823466385288598117041555032935220459e+38
```

### **Conclusion:**
- The program shows the smallest and largest floating-point values for both `float32` and `float64`.
- `float64` has a larger range and more precision than `float32`, which is why it can represent much smaller and larger numbers.
- Using the **`math`** package constants, you can handle very large and small numbers and understand their limitations in Go.
