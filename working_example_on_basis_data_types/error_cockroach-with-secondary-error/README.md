The Go code you provided demonstrates how to use the `errors` package from CockroachDB to work with error wrapping and secondary errors. Let's break down the rules and the behavior of this code.

### **Code Explanation**

#### 1. **Initial Setup**
```go
err := io.EOF
err = errors.WithSecondaryError(err, context.Canceled)
```
- **`io.EOF`** is assigned to `err`. This is a standard EOF (End of File) error in Go, often used to indicate the end of data when reading from a stream.
- **`errors.WithSecondaryError(err, context.Canceled)`** wraps `err` (which is `io.EOF`) and attaches a secondary error (`context.Canceled`).
  - This means that `err` now has two associated errors:
    - The primary error: `io.EOF`
    - The secondary error: `context.Canceled`
  
  The `WithSecondaryError` function allows you to attach an additional error to the original error, creating an error chain where the primary error is `io.EOF` and the secondary error is `context.Canceled`.

#### 2. **Printing the Errors**
```go
fmt.Println(err)
```
- This prints the primary error, which is `io.EOF`. The result will be:
  ```
  EOF
  ```
  
  The `fmt.Println` will print only the **primary error**, not including secondary errors.

#### 3. **Printing the Full Error Information**
```go
fmt.Printf("%+v", err)
```
- Here, `%+v` is used to print the full error, including all relevant information such as error chains and secondary errors.
- The output will be:
  ```
  EOF
  (1) secondary error attachment
    | context canceled
    | (1) context canceled
    | Error types: (1) *errors.errorString
  Wraps: (2) EOF
  Error types: (1) *secondary.withSecondaryError (2) *errors.errorString
  ```
  
  This output contains:
  - **`EOF`**: The primary error.
  - **`secondary error attachment`**: A secondary error (`context.Canceled`) attached to the primary error.
  - **`context canceled`**: The description of the secondary error.
  - **`Wraps: (2) EOF`**: Shows the chain of errors. The secondary error (`context.Canceled`) is attached to the primary error (`EOF`).
  - **`Error types`**: Shows the error types involved in the chain. Here, the error is of type `*secondary.withSecondaryError` (representing the primary error with a secondary one attached) and `*errors.errorString` (representing the base errors like `io.EOF`).

#### 4. **Using `errors.Is` to Check for Errors**
```go
fmt.Println(errors.Is(err, io.EOF))           // true
fmt.Println(errors.Is(err, context.Canceled)) // false
```
- **`errors.Is(err, io.EOF)`**: This checks if the primary error (`err`) is equivalent to `io.EOF`. Since `err` was initially set to `io.EOF` and wrapped with a secondary error, the check will **return `true`**. The `errors.Is` function compares the primary error to the target error (`io.EOF`) in the chain and returns `true` if they match.
  
- **`errors.Is(err, context.Canceled)`**: This checks if the primary error (`err`) is equivalent to `context.Canceled`. Since `context.Canceled` is a **secondary error** (attached to `io.EOF`), this check will **return `false`**. The `errors.Is` function only checks the primary error, not the secondary one.

### **Explanation of the Key Functions**

1. **`errors.WithSecondaryError`**:
   - This function is used to wrap an error and attach a secondary error to it.
   - The primary error is the one that is returned when you print the error using `fmt.Println`.
   - The secondary error is associated with the primary error and can be inspected with `%+v` (which shows more detailed error information).

2. **`errors.Is`**:
   - `errors.Is` is used to check if an error in a chain matches a specific target error.
   - It will check the primary error in the chain and return `true` if it matches.
   - In the example, `errors.Is(err, io.EOF)` returns `true` because the primary error is `io.EOF`, but `errors.Is(err, context.Canceled)` returns `false` because `context.Canceled` is a secondary error, not the primary one.

### **Summary of Rules**

1. **Primary vs. Secondary Errors**:
   - The primary error is the main error that is directly associated with the operation that failed. In this case, it’s `io.EOF`.
   - The secondary error is an additional error attached to the primary one, which provides more context. In this case, it’s `context.Canceled`.

2. **Printing Errors**:
   - `fmt.Println(err)` prints the primary error only.
   - `fmt.Printf("%+v", err)` prints both the primary error and any attached secondary errors with detailed information about the error chain.

3. **`errors.Is`**:
   - `errors.Is` only checks the **primary error** in the error chain.
   - It returns `true` if the primary error matches the target error, otherwise it returns `false`.

4. **Error Chains**:
   - When using `errors.WithSecondaryError`, a secondary error is attached to the primary error, but it is not included in `fmt.Println` outputs. It is only visible when using detailed printing like `%+v`.
   
5. **Error Type Information**:
   - The error types printed with `%+v` show the full chain of errors and their types, helping you understand how the errors are wrapped and what types they are.

This code demonstrates a common pattern for error wrapping and inspecting in Go, allowing you to attach additional context (secondary errors) to your primary errors and handle them accordingly.
