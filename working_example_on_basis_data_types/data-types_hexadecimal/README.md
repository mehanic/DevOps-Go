In this Go program, the `fmt.Printf` function is used to format and print output in different formats. Letâ€™s break down the rules for each of the `fmt.Printf` statements and explain how the formatting works.

### **First `fmt.Printf` Statement**:
```go
fmt.Printf("%d : %x\n", 35, 35)
```

#### **Explanation**:
1. **`%d`**:
   - The `%d` format specifier is used to print an integer in **decimal** (base 10) format.
   - So, `35` will be printed as `35` in decimal.

2. **`%x`**:
   - The `%x` format specifier is used to print an integer in **hexadecimal** (base 16) format.
   - So, `35` will be printed as `23` in hexadecimal (`35` in decimal is equal to `23` in hexadecimal).

#### **Output**:
```
35 : 23
```

- `35` is printed as decimal (`%d`), and `35` is printed as hexadecimal (`%x`).

---

### **Second `fmt.Printf` Statement**:
```go
fmt.Printf("%d : %#x\n", 35, 35)
```

#### **Explanation**:
1. **`%d`**:
   - As in the previous case, `%d` prints the integer `35` in decimal format, so it will print `35`.

2. **`%#x`**:
   - The `%#x` format specifier prints the integer in **hexadecimal** format but with a **prefix** (`0x`) indicating that it is a hexadecimal number.
   - So, `35` will be printed as `0x23` in hexadecimal (`35` in decimal is equal to `23` in hexadecimal, and the `0x` prefix is added to indicate it's a hexadecimal number).

#### **Output**:
```
35 : 0x23
```

- `35` is printed as decimal (`%d`), and `35` is printed as hexadecimal with a `0x` prefix (`%#x`).

---

### **Summary of Format Specifiers**:
- **`%d`**: Prints the integer in decimal (base 10) format.
- **`%x`**: Prints the integer in hexadecimal (base 16) format without any prefix.
- **`%#x`**: Prints the integer in hexadecimal (base 16) format with a `0x` prefix.

### **Final Explanation**:

The output of the program consists of two lines:
1. The first line prints the integer `35` as both decimal (`35`) and hexadecimal (`23`).
2. The second line prints the integer `35` as decimal (`35`) and hexadecimal with a `0x` prefix (`0x23`). 

Thus, the `fmt.Printf` statements are used to demonstrate how Go can format integers in different ways, both without and with a prefix for hexadecimal values.
