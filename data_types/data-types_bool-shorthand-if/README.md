This Go program demonstrates how logical operators (`!`, `||`, `&&`) work in conditional statements (`if` statements). These operators are commonly used to evaluate boolean expressions. Let’s break down each part of the program and explain the rules:

### 1. **Logical NOT (`!`)**
   - The **logical NOT** operator (`!`) inverts the boolean value of its operand. If the value is `true`, it becomes `false`, and if it's `false`, it becomes `true`.
   - **Syntax**: `!condition`
   - **Explanation**: 
     - `!false` becomes `true`.
     - In the `if` statement, the condition `!false` is evaluated to `true`, so the block of code inside the `if` statement will execute.

   ```go
   if !false {
       fmt.Println("this ran")
   }
   ```
   - **Output:**
     ```bash
     this ran
     ```

   - **Explanation**:  
     - `!false` is `true`, so the condition evaluates to `true` and the message `"this ran"` is printed.

### 2. **Logical OR (`||`)**
   - The **logical OR** operator (`||`) evaluates to `true` if **at least one** of the operands is `true`. It only evaluates to `false` when both operands are `false`.
   - **Syntax**: `condition1 || condition2`
   - **Explanation**: 
     - `false || true` evaluates to `true` because one of the conditions (`true`) is `true`. As a result, the block of code inside the `if` statement is executed.

   ```go
   if false || true {
       fmt.Println("this ran")
   }
   ```
   - **Output:**
     ```bash
     this ran
     ```

   - **Explanation**:  
     - `false || true` evaluates to `true`, so the condition is true, and the message `"this ran"` is printed.

### 3. **Logical AND (`&&`)**
   - The **logical AND** operator (`&&`) evaluates to `true` if **both** operands are `true`. If either of the operands is `false`, the result is `false`.
   - **Syntax**: `condition1 && condition2`
   - **Explanation**: 
     - `false && true` evaluates to `false` because one of the conditions (`false`) is `false`. As a result, the block of code inside the `if` statement does **not** execute.

   ```go
   if false && true {
       fmt.Println("this did not run")
   }
   ```
   - **Output:**
     ```bash
     (nothing is printed)
     ```

   - **Explanation**:  
     - `false && true` evaluates to `false`, so the condition is false, and the code block `"this did not run"` does not get executed.

### Summary of Logical Operators:
- **`!` (NOT)**: Inverts the boolean value of its operand.
  - `!true` → `false`, `!false` → `true`
- **`||` (OR)**: Evaluates to `true` if at least one operand is `true`.
  - `true || true` → `true`, `false || true` → `true`, `false || false` → `false`
- **`&&` (AND)**: Evaluates to `true` only if both operands are `true`.
  - `true && true` → `true`, `false && true` → `false`, `false && false` → `false`

### Truth Table for Logical Operators:

- **AND (`&&`)**:
  | A     | B     | A && B |
  |-------|-------|--------|
  | true  | true  | true   |
  | true  | false | false  |
  | false | true  | false  |
  | false | false | false  |

- **OR (`||`)**:
  | A     | B     | A || B |
  |-------|-------|--------|
  | true  | true  | true   |
  | true  | false | true   |
  | false | true  | true   |
  | false | false | false  |

- **NOT (`!`)**:
  | A     | !A     |
  |-------|--------|
  | true  | false  |
  | false | true   |

This program helps you understand how to combine conditions using these logical operators and how they affect the flow of control in your program based on boolean expressions.
