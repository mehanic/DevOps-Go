This Go program demonstrates the usage of **floating-point numbers** and **complex numbers** in Go. Let's break it down and explain the rules:

### **1. Floating-Point Numbers**
Go supports two types of floating-point numbers:

- **`float32`**: A single-precision floating-point number that uses 32 bits (4 bytes).
- **`float64`**: A double-precision floating-point number that uses 64 bits (8 bytes).

In the program:
```go
var h float32 = 3.14              // single-precision floating-point
var i float64 = 3.141592653589793 // double-precision
```
- **`h`** is a variable of type `float32`. It's initialized with the value `3.14`. Since `float32` is single-precision, it stores this number with lower precision compared to `float64`.
- **`i`** is a variable of type `float64`. It's initialized with the value `3.141592653589793`. `float64` is double-precision and can store numbers with more precision and a larger range than `float32`.

The precision difference is important because `float64` can handle more digits after the decimal point without losing accuracy.

### **2. Printing the Values of `h` and `i`**
```go
fmt.Println("h=", h)
fmt.Println("i=", i)
```
This part prints the values of `h` (float32) and `i` (float64). Go automatically chooses the appropriate formatting based on the variable type, so it will display them as floating-point numbers.

### **3. Complex Numbers**
Go also supports complex numbers. A complex number has two parts:
- **Real part**
- **Imaginary part**

Go has two types for complex numbers:
- **`complex64`**: A complex number with both the real and imaginary parts as `float32`.
- **`complex128`**: A complex number with both the real and imaginary parts as `float64`.

In the program:
```go
var j complex64 = 1 + 2i  // complex number with float32 real and imaginary parts
var k complex128 = 1 + 2i // complex number with float64 real and imaginary parts
```
- **`j`** is a variable of type `complex64`. It's initialized with the value `1 + 2i`, where `1` is the real part and `2` is the imaginary part. Both parts are `float32` because it's a `complex64`.
- **`k`** is a variable of type `complex128`. It's initialized with the value `1 + 2i`, where `1` is the real part and `2` is the imaginary part. Both parts are `float64` because it's a `complex128`.

### **4. Printing the Complex Numbers**
```go
fmt.Println("j=", j)
fmt.Println("k=", k)
```
This part prints the values of the complex numbers `j` and `k`. Go will display complex numbers in the form `a + bi`, where `a` is the real part, and `b` is the imaginary part.

### **Key Points:**
- **Floating-point types** (`float32`, `float64`) are used for numbers with decimals. `float64` is the default for most floating-point operations in Go because it provides higher precision.
- **Complex types** (`complex64`, `complex128`) are used for numbers that have both real and imaginary parts. The difference is that `complex128` provides higher precision by using `float64` for both the real and imaginary parts.
- **Precision**: `float64` and `complex128` offer greater precision than `float32` and `complex64` respectively.

### **Example Output:**
```go
float32 and float64:
h= 3.14
i= 3.141592653589793

Complex Numbers:
j= (1+2i)
k= (1+2i)
```

Here:
- `h` is printed as `3.14` because it's a `float32`.
- `i` is printed as `3.141592653589793` with higher precision because it's a `float64`.
- `j` and `k` are both printed as `1+2i` because they are complex numbers with real and imaginary parts.

### **Conclusion:**
- **`float32`** and **`float64`** are used for floating-point values, with `float64` offering higher precision.
- **`complex64`** and **`complex128`** are used for complex numbers, with `complex128` providing higher precision due to using `float64` for the real and imaginary parts.
- The program demonstrates the creation, assignment, and printing of both floating-point and complex numbers in Go.
