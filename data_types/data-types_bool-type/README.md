This Go program demonstrates some fundamental concepts in Go such as variable declaration, the default value of uninitialized variables, and comparison operations. Let's go through each part of the code to explain the rules.

### 1. **Global Variable Declaration**
   ```go
   var x bool
   ```
   - In Go, when you declare a variable without explicitly initializing it, the variable gets a **default value** based on its type.
   - The type `bool` has a default value of `false`. So, `x` is initialized to `false` automatically. This is why `fmt.Println(x)` prints `false` the first time it's called.

### 2. **Printing the Uninitialized Variable**
   ```go
   fmt.Println(x)
   ```
   - Since `x` is declared globally and has the type `bool`, its default value is `false`. Therefore, when we print it the first time, it outputs `false`.

### 3. **Assigning a Value to the Variable**
   ```go
   x = true
   ```
   - Here, you explicitly assign the value `true` to the variable `x`. This updates the value of `x` from its default value (`false`) to `true`.

### 4. **Printing the Updated Variable**
   ```go
   fmt.Println(x)
   ```
   - After the assignment `x = true`, when you print `x` again, it outputs `true` because we explicitly set its value.

### 5. **Calling Another Function (`foo`)**
   ```go
   foo()
   ```
   - The program calls the `foo` function, where two local variables `a` and `b` are declared and initialized.

### 6. **Comparison of Local Variables in `foo`**
   ```go
   a := 10
   b := 100
   fmt.Println(a == b)
   ```
   - In the `foo` function, two variables `a` and `b` are declared using **short declaration** (`:=`), which both initializes and declares them in one step.
   - `a` is assigned the value `10` and `b` is assigned the value `100`.
   - The comparison `a == b` checks if `a` is equal to `b`. Since `10` is not equal to `100`, the expression `a == b` evaluates to `false`, and `false` is printed as the output.

### Summary of Outputs:
- **First Print (x value before assignment)**:  
  The variable `x` is declared globally as a `bool`, and it has the default value `false`.  
  **Output**: `false`

- **Second Print (x value after assignment)**:  
  The value of `x` is explicitly set to `true`, so it prints `true`.  
  **Output**: `true`

- **Comparison in `foo()` function**:  
  Inside the `foo` function, we compare `a` and `b`. Since `10` is not equal to `100`, it prints `false`.  
  **Output**: `false`

### Final Output:
```bash
false
true
false
```

### Key Concepts:
1. **Default Value of Variables**:  
   - Uninitialized variables in Go have default values based on their type. For example, `bool` defaults to `false`.
   
2. **Assignment**:  
   - You can assign a value to a variable at any time, and if it's a global variable, the value persists throughout the program.

3. **Short Variable Declaration**:  
   - The `:=` operator is used to declare and initialize local variables in one step within functions.

4. **Comparison Operators**:  
   - The `==` operator compares two values for equality. If the values are equal, it returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
