This Go program demonstrates **type conversion**, **mismatched types**, and **working with different types** (such as `int`, `float64`, `string`, etc.). Letâ€™s break it down:

---

## âœ… **1. Type Inference and Mismatched Types:**

```go
x := 10
y := 10.0
```
- `x` is **inferred as an `int`** (since `10` is an integer).
- `y` is **inferred as a `float64`** (since `10.0` is a floating-point number).

### **Printing Values and Types:**

```go
fmt.Printf("%v %T\n", x, x)
fmt.Printf("%v %T\n", y, y)
```

- **`%v`** prints the value of the variable.
- **`%T`** prints the type of the variable.

Output:
```
10 int
10 float64
```

### **Mismatched Types Error:**
```go
fmt.Println(x + y)
```

- **Error**: `invalid operation: x + y (mismatched types int and float64)`
- **Reason**: Even though both `x` and `y` are numbers, they are **different types**: `int` (integer) and `float64` (floating-point). Go is **strongly typed**, meaning operations between mismatched types (like `int` and `float64`) are not allowed directly.

---

## âœ… **2. Type Conversion:**

You can convert between types explicitly using **type conversion**.

### **Converting `float64` to `int`:**
```go
fmt.Println(x + int(y)) // Convert y (float64) to int
```

- **`int(y)`** converts `y` (which is a `float64`) to an `int`, discarding the fractional part. This makes `x` and `y` both `int`, allowing them to be added together.

Output: `20`

### **Converting `int` to `float64`:**
```go
fmt.Println(y + float64(x)) // Convert x (int) to float64
```

- **`float64(x)`** converts `x` (which is an `int`) to a `float64`, allowing addition with `y`.

Output: `20.0`

---

## âœ… **3. Type Conversion with Different Sized Integers:**
```go
var x1 int16 = 128
var y1 int8
y1 = int8(x1)
```

- **`int16`** is a 16-bit integer, and **`int8`** is an 8-bit integer.
- **Type Conversion**: Weâ€™re trying to convert `x1` (which is an `int16`) to an `int8`. Since `int8` can only hold values between `-128` and `127`, the value `128` overflows and wraps around.
  - **Overflow**: `128` becomes `-128` when cast to `int8` (because of the limited range of `int8`).

Output: `-128`

---

## âœ… **4. String Concatenation with `string` and `int`:**

```go
a := "100"
b := 106
fmt.Println(a + string(b))     // "100"
fmt.Println(a + fmt.Sprint(b)) // "1001"
```

- **`a + string(b)`**: This converts the `int` `b` (106) to its **ASCII character representation**, which is the character `j` (because `106` is the ASCII value for `j`). The result is `"100" + "j"` â†’ `"100j"`.
  
- **`a + fmt.Sprint(b)`**: **`fmt.Sprint(b)`** converts the integer `b` to a **string representation** (`"106"`), so the result is `"100" + "106"` â†’ `"100106"`.

### **Summary of Key Concepts:**

| Concept                        | Explanation |
|---------------------------------|-------------|
| **Mismatched Types**            | Go does not allow operations between values of different types directly (e.g., `int + float64`). |
| **Type Conversion**             | You can convert between types (e.g., `int` to `float64`, `float64` to `int`) explicitly. |
| **Overflow and Wrapping**       | Converting between integer types with different sizes (e.g., `int16` to `int8`) can cause **overflow**. |
| **String and Integer Concatenation** | Converting integers to strings can be done using **`string()`** for ASCII conversion or **`fmt.Sprint()`** for string conversion. |
