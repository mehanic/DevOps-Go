Let's break down the rules and concepts used in the Go code step-by-step:

### **1. Converting a string to bytes**

```go
str := "hey"
fmt.Printf(`"hey" as bytes   : %d`+"\n", []byte(str))
```

- **String to Bytes**: In Go, strings are a sequence of characters (UTF-8 encoded), and they can be converted into a byte slice (`[]byte`) using the `[]byte(str)` syntax.
- **Output**: This converts the string `"hey"` into its byte representation and prints:
  ```
  "hey" as bytes   : [104 101 121]
  ```
  - The string `"hey"` corresponds to the following ASCII values for the characters:
    - `'h' = 104`
    - `'e' = 101`
    - `'y' = 121`

### **2. Converting bytes to a string**

```go
bytes := []byte{104, 101, 121}
fmt.Printf("bytes as string  : %q\n", string(bytes))
```

- **Bytes to String**: You can convert a byte slice (`[]byte`) back to a string using `string(bytes)`.
- **Output**: This converts the byte slice `[104, 101, 121]` back into the string `"hey"` and prints:
  ```
  bytes as string  : "hey"
  ```

### **3. Runes and Unicode Code Points**

```go
fmt.Printf("%c                : %[1]d\n", 'h')
fmt.Printf("%c                : %[1]d\n", 'e')
fmt.Printf("%c                : %[1]d\n", 'y')
```

- **Runes and Unicode**: A **rune** in Go is an alias for the `int32` type and represents a Unicode code point. The `%c` format verb is used to print the character corresponding to the rune value.
  - In Go, characters (like `'h'`, `'e'`, `'y'`) are represented as Unicode code points (numeric values).
- **Output**: For each character, we print both the character and its Unicode code point (using `%d` for the number):
  ```
  h                : 104
  e                : 101
  y                : 121
  ```

  - `'h'` corresponds to Unicode code point `104`
  - `'e'` corresponds to Unicode code point `101`
  - `'y'` corresponds to Unicode code point `121`

### **4. Runes are Typeless**

```go
var (
    anInt   int   = 'h'
    anInt8  int8  = 'h'
    anInt16 int16 = 'h'
    anInt32 int32 = 'h'

    aRune = 'h'
)
```

- **Typeless Runes**: When using a rune literal (e.g., `'h'`), Go infers it as an `int32` by default, but you can assign it to any numeric type (like `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`), as demonstrated here.
- **Output**: The type of each variable is displayed using `%T`:
  ```
  rune literals are typeless:
      int int8 int16 int32 int32
  ```
  - All of these variables hold the Unicode code point `104`, but they are different types: `int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, and the default type `rune` (which is an `int32`).

### **5. Rune Literals as Numeric Values**

```go
fmt.Printf("%q in decimal: %[1]d\n", 104)
fmt.Printf("%q in binary : %08[1]b\n", 'h')
fmt.Printf("%q in hex    : 0x%[1]x\n", 0x68)
```

- **Rune as Number**: A rune literal is just a numeric value that represents a Unicode code point.
  - `%d` prints the decimal representation of the rune.
  - `%b` prints the binary representation.
  - `%x` prints the hexadecimal representation.
  
- **Output**:
  ```
  'h' in decimal: 104
  'h' in binary : 01101000
  'h' in hex    : 0x68
  ```

  - `'h'` is `104` in decimal.
  - `'h'` is `01101000` in binary (8 bits).
  - `'h'` is `0x68` in hexadecimal.

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Strings**: In Go, strings are UTF-8 encoded sequences of characters, and they can be converted to bytes (`[]byte`) and vice versa.
- **Bytes**: A byte is simply a `uint8` (0-255) representing a character in a string (or other binary data).
- **Runes**: A rune represents a Unicode code point, which is an `int32` (it can store more than 4 billion unique characters).
- **Unicode**: Characters like `'h'`, `'e'`, and `'y'` are mapped to Unicode code points, and these can be displayed in different number systems (decimal, binary, hexadecimal).
- **Rune Literals**: Rune literals are typeless (they default to `rune`, which is `int32`), but you can assign them to other numeric types (`int`, `int8`, etc.).
