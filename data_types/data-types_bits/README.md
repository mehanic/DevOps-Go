This Go program demonstrates how to work with binary numbers, and how to format them in various ways using the `fmt.Printf` function with the `%b` format specifier, as well as how to calculate the value of binary numbers.

Let's break down each section of the program and explain the rules:

### 1. **Printing Binary Values using `%b`:**
   - The `%b` format verb in Go prints the binary representation of an integer. For example:
     ```go
     fmt.Printf("%b\n", 0)  // prints binary representation of 0: 0
     fmt.Printf("%b\n", 1)  // prints binary representation of 1: 1
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```bash
     0
     1
     ```
   - **Explanation**:  
     - `0` in binary is `0`.
     - `1` in binary is `1`.

### 2. **Using `%02b` to Print 2 Bits with Leading Zeros:**
   - The `%02b` format verb tells Go to print a binary number using **2 bits**, and to add **leading zeros** if the number requires fewer than 2 bits.
     ```go
     fmt.Printf("%02b = %d\n", 0, 0)
     fmt.Printf("%02b = %d\n", 1, 1)
     fmt.Printf("%02b = %d\n", 2, 2)
     fmt.Printf("%02b = %d\n", 3, 3)
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```bash
     00 = 0
     01 = 1
     10 = 2
     11 = 3
     ```
   - **Explanation**:  
     - `00` is the binary representation of `0`, `01` is the binary representation of `1`, and so on.
     - **Leading zeros** are added to ensure the binary value is always 2 bits wide.

### 3. **Using `%08b` to Print 8 Bits with Leading Zeros:**
   - The `%08b` format verb tells Go to print the binary number using **8 bits**, adding leading zeros if necessary.
     ```go
     fmt.Printf("%08b = %d\n", 1, 1)
     fmt.Printf("%08b = %d\n", 2, 2)
     fmt.Printf("%08b = %d\n", 4, 4)
     fmt.Printf("%08b = %d\n", 8, 8)
     fmt.Printf("%08b = %d\n", 16, 16)
     fmt.Printf("%08b = %d\n", 32, 32)
     fmt.Printf("%08b = %d\n", 64, 64)
     fmt.Printf("%08b = %d\n", 128, 128)
     ```
     **Output:**
     ```bash
     00000001 = 1
     00000010 = 2
     00000100 = 4
     00001000 = 8
     00010000 = 16
     00100000 = 32
     01000000 = 64
     10000000 = 128
     ```
   - **Explanation**:  
     - Each number is represented in **8 bits**.
     - The leading zeros ensure the number is 8 bits wide.

### 4. **How to Calculate the Value of a Binary Number:**
   - A **binary number** is a series of 0s and 1s, where each digit represents a power of 2. The rightmost digit is `2^0`, the next one is `2^1`, and so on. The value of the binary number is the sum of these powers of 2 where the corresponding bit is 1.

   - **Example 1:**
     ```go
     i, _ := strconv.ParseInt("00000010", 2, 64)
     fmt.Println(i)
     ```
     **Explanation:**
     - The binary number `00000010` can be calculated as follows:
       ```
       0 * 2^7 = 0
       0 * 2^6 = 0
       0 * 2^5 = 0
       0 * 2^4 = 0
       0 * 2^3 = 0
       0 * 2^2 = 0
       1 * 2^1 = 2
       0 * 2^0 = 0
       ```
     - The total is `2`.

     **Output:**
     ```bash
     2
     ```

   - **Example 2:**
     ```go
     i, _ = strconv.ParseInt("00010110", 2, 64)
     fmt.Println(i)
     ```
     **Explanation:**
     - The binary number `00010110` can be calculated as:
       ```
       0 * 2^7 = 0
       0 * 2^6 = 0
       0 * 2^5 = 0
       1 * 2^4 = 16
       0 * 2^3 = 0
       1 * 2^2 = 4
       1 * 2^1 = 2
       0 * 2^0 = 0
       ```
     - The total is `16 + 4 + 2 = 22`.

     **Output:**
     ```bash
     22
     ```

### 5. **Using `strconv.ParseInt` to Parse Binary Strings:**
   - The function `strconv.ParseInt` is used to convert a string to an integer.
     ```go
     i, _ := strconv.ParseInt("00000010", 2, 64)
     ```
     - The first argument is the binary string.
     - The second argument (`2`) specifies that the string is in **base 2** (binary).
     - The third argument (`64`) specifies that the result should fit in a 64-bit integer.

### Summary of Key Concepts:
1. **Binary Representation:**
   - `%b` prints an integer in binary format.
   - `%02b` and `%08b` format the binary number with leading zeros for a specific bit width (2 or 8 bits).

2. **Bit Values and Powers of 2:**
   - Each bit in a binary number represents a power of 2.
   - The rightmost bit represents `2^0`, the next one represents `2^1`, and so on.
   - You can calculate the decimal value by summing the powers of 2 where the corresponding binary digit is `1`.

3. **`strconv.ParseInt`:**
   - This function is used to parse a binary string into an integer, using the base `2` for binary.

This program teaches how to manipulate binary numbers, format them for display, and convert them to decimal values by understanding the position of each bit in the binary representation.
