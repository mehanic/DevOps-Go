In this Go program, we're working with **booleans**, which are data types that can only hold two values: `true` or `false`. Let's go step by step:

### 1. **Declaring Boolean Variables**
```go
var l bool = true
var m bool = false
```

- **`l`** and **`m`** are **boolean** variables. In Go, the `bool` type can only store two values:
  - `true` (indicating a true or affirmative condition),
  - `false` (indicating a false or negated condition).
  
- In this code, `l` is explicitly assigned the value `true`, and `m` is assigned the value `false`.

### 2. **Printing the Boolean Variables**
```go
fmt.Println("l=", l)
fmt.Println("m=", m)
```

- **`fmt.Println("l=", l)`**: This prints the label `l=` followed by the value of the variable `l`. Since `l` was assigned `true`, it prints `l=true`.
  
- **`fmt.Println("m=", m)`**: Similarly, this prints the label `m=` followed by the value of the variable `m`. Since `m` was assigned `false`, it prints `m=false`.

### Output:
```
booleans:
l=true
m=false
```

### **Summary:**
- The program declares two boolean variables, `l` and `m`, and assigns them the values `true` and `false` respectively.
- Then, it prints the values of these variables.

This is a simple demonstration of how to declare and print boolean variables in Go. Boolean values are commonly used for conditional checks (`if` statements) and logical operations (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
