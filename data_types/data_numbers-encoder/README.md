In this Go program, different number systems (decimal, octal, and hexadecimal) are used to represent the number `15`. Let's go through each part of the code to understand how the numbers are represented and printed.

### 1. **Decimal Number (Base 10)**

```go
number0 := 15
```
- The number `15` is represented in **decimal** (base 10), which is the most common number system that we use daily.
- In **decimal**:
  - Each digit represents a power of 10.
  - `15` is simply the number fifteen in base 10, so `number0` is assigned the value `15`.

### 2. **Octal Number (Base 8)**

```go
number1 := 017
```
- The number `017` is represented in **octal** (base 8).
- In **octal**:
  - A number prefixed with `0` is treated as octal in Go.
  - `017` is an octal representation of a number. To convert `017` from octal to decimal, we can expand it as follows:
    \[
    017_{\text{octal}} = 1 \times 8^1 + 7 \times 8^0 = 8 + 7 = 15_{\text{decimal}}
    \]
  - So, `017` is equal to `15` in decimal.

### 3. **Hexadecimal Number (Base 16)**

```go
number2 := 0x0F
```
- The number `0x0F` is represented in **hexadecimal** (base 16).
- In **hexadecimal**:
  - A number prefixed with `0x` is treated as hexadecimal in Go.
  - Hexadecimal uses digits from `0-9` and `A-F`, where `A` represents 10, `B` represents 11, and so on up to `F`, which represents 15.
  - `0x0F` means "zero F" in hexadecimal. To convert `0x0F` to decimal:
    \[
    0x0F_{\text{hex}} = 0 \times 16^1 + 15 \times 16^0 = 0 + 15 = 15_{\text{decimal}}
    \]
  - So, `0x0F` is equal to `15` in decimal.

### 4. **Printing the Values**

```go
fmt.Println(number0, number1, number2)
```
- The `fmt.Println` function prints the values of `number0`, `number1`, and `number2`. Since all of them are equal to `15` in decimal (even though they were defined using different bases), the output will be:
  ```
  15 15 15
  ```

### **Summary of Number Systems**

- **Decimal (Base 10)**: The standard number system, where each digit is a power of 10. `15` in decimal is `15`.
- **Octal (Base 8)**: Numbers are expressed using digits `0-7`. `017` in octal is `15` in decimal.
- **Hexadecimal (Base 16)**: Numbers are expressed using digits `0-9` and letters `A-F`. `0x0F` in hexadecimal is `15` in decimal.

In Go:
- Decimal is written normally.
- Octal is prefixed with `0` (e.g., `017`).
- Hexadecimal is prefixed with `0x` (e.g., `0x0F`).

Despite using different bases, all these representations result in the same decimal value `15`.
