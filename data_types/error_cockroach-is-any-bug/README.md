This Go code contains a bug related to the usage of the `errors.IsAny` function from the **CockroachDB errors** package. It also demonstrates an issue that causes a **runtime panic** when calling `errors.IsAny` with custom error types.

Letâ€™s break down the code and the issue:

### **1. Defining the `SimpleWrapper` Type**

```go
type SimpleWrapper struct {
	err error
}
```

Here, a custom error type `SimpleWrapper` is defined, which holds another `error` (`err`). This will allow you to create wrapped errors that have a "wrapped" `err` inside them.

### **2. Implementing `Error` and `Unwrap` Methods**

```go
func (w SimpleWrapper) Error() string {
	return "boom!"
}

func (w SimpleWrapper) Unwrap() error {
	return w.err
}
```

The `SimpleWrapper` type implements the `error` interface by providing the `Error()` method that simply returns the string `"boom!"`. It also implements the `Unwrap()` method, which is used to access the underlying error (`err`) inside the wrapper.

The `Unwrap()` method allows this error to be unwrapped, making it compatible with error inspection functions like `errors.Is` and `errors.As`.

### **3. Wrapping Errors with `errors.WithStack`**

```go
stack := errors.WithStack
ref := stack(stack(SimpleWrapper{}))
err := stack(stack(SimpleWrapper{err: stack(errors.New("boom!"))}))
```

- `stack := errors.WithStack` assigns the `WithStack` function from the `errors` package to the variable `stack`. This function is used to add a stack trace to an error.
  
- `ref := stack(stack(SimpleWrapper{}))` creates a new `SimpleWrapper` instance, and then it is wrapped with `errors.WithStack` to include the stack trace. So `ref` is a `SimpleWrapper` with a stack trace attached.

- `err := stack(stack(SimpleWrapper{err: stack(errors.New("boom!"))}))` creates another `SimpleWrapper` instance that wraps an error with the message `"boom!"` and applies the stack trace to this wrapped error.

At this point, you have a `SimpleWrapper` (`ref`) and a wrapped error (`err`) where `err` is a `SimpleWrapper` wrapping another error (`boom!`).

### **4. Checking if Errors Match with `errors.IsAny`**

```go
if errors.IsAny(err, ref) {
	fmt.Println("gotcha!")
}
```

- `errors.IsAny(err, ref)` is used to check if `err` matches any of the errors in `ref` (or vice versa). If they match, it will print `"gotcha!"`.

However, there's a **bug** here: when `errors.IsAny` is used with custom error types like `SimpleWrapper`, the package is supposed to compare the errors and identify if any of the wrapped errors match. But the comparison logic has an issue, which causes the runtime panic.

### **The Runtime Panic Issue**

The comment in the code states that running this program causes a **runtime panic**:

```
panic: runtime error: index out of range [3] with length 3
```

This error originates in the `markers.equalMarks` function inside the `cockroachdb/errors` package when `errors.IsAny` tries to compare the two errors.

- The panic is happening because `errors.IsAny` is trying to access an index in a slice that is out of range. The `IsAny` function expects to compare errors in a specific way (with an internal marker), but in this case, the comparison fails due to an unexpected structure or format of the wrapped errors.

### **Cause of the Bug**

The issue seems to be in how the stack-traced errors are being compared using `errors.IsAny`. When wrapping an error using `errors.WithStack`, it adds additional metadata (the stack trace), and the comparison might not correctly handle these cases, causing it to fail when trying to inspect the chain of wrapped errors.

### **Workaround**

While this bug might need to be fixed in the CockroachDB `errors` package itself, as a workaround, you could manually unwrap the errors using `errors.Unwrap` before calling `errors.IsAny`. This would allow you to check if the underlying errors are the same without triggering the panic.

Alternatively, you could avoid using `errors.IsAny` for complex wrapped errors or wait for an update that addresses this bug.

### **Summary**

- The code demonstrates how to wrap errors using `SimpleWrapper` and how to add a stack trace with `errors.WithStack`.
- The bug occurs when using `errors.IsAny` with wrapped errors that include stack traces.
- The `errors.IsAny` function causes a runtime panic because it cannot properly compare wrapped errors with stack traces.
- The panic message is: `runtime error: index out of range [3] with length 3`.

To avoid the issue, a workaround might involve manually unwrapping errors or simplifying error comparisons until the bug is fixed.
