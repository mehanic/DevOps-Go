This Go program demonstrates **concurrent programming** using goroutines, **atomic operations**, and **sync.WaitGroup**. Let's break it down to understand the logic behind each part.

### **Understanding the Code:**

#### **1. The `clicker` type and its methods:**
```go
type clicker int32
```
- A new type `clicker` is defined, which is an alias for the built-in type `int32`. This allows us to use `clicker` just like an integer, but with the flexibility to add custom methods for atomic operations.

#### **2. The `Click` method:**
```go
func (c *clicker) Click() int32 {
	return atomic.AddInt32((*int32)(c), 1)
}
```
- This method increments the value of the `clicker` using the `atomic.AddInt32` function. The `atomic.AddInt32` function ensures that the increment operation is thread-safe (i.e., it guarantees no race conditions when accessed by multiple goroutines).
- The method returns the new value after the increment.

#### **3. The `Reset` method:**
```go
func (c *clicker) Reset() {
	atomic.StoreInt32((*int32)(c), 0)
}
```
- This method sets the value of the `clicker` to `0` using the `atomic.StoreInt32` function, which performs the reset operation atomically, ensuring no race conditions when resetting the value.

#### **4. The `Value` method:**
```go
func (c *clicker) Value() int32 {
	return atomic.LoadInt32((*int32)(c))
}
```
- This method retrieves the current value of the `clicker` using the `atomic.LoadInt32` function. This ensures that the value is read atomically, meaning it will always give the correct value, even when accessed concurrently by multiple goroutines.

#### **5. The `main` function:**
```go
func main() {
	c := clicker(0)
	wg := sync.WaitGroup{}
	// 2*iteration + reset at 5
	wg.Add(21)
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		go func() {
			c.Click()
			fmt.Println("click")
			wg.Done()
		}()
		go func() {
			fmt.Println("load", c.Value())
			wg.Done()
		}()
		if i == 0 || i%5 != 0 {
			continue
		}
		fmt.Println(i)
		go func() {
			c.Reset()
			fmt.Println("reset")
			wg.Done()
		}()
	}
	wg.Wait()
}
```

- **Initialization:**
  - A `clicker` variable `c` is initialized to `0`.
  - A `sync.WaitGroup` (`wg`) is used to wait for all goroutines to complete before the program terminates. The `wg.Add(21)` means we are expecting 21 tasks to finish (as there are 21 calls to `wg.Done()`).
  
- **Loop:**
  - The loop runs 10 times (`i` from 0 to 9).
  
  - **Goroutines:**
    - Inside each loop iteration, two goroutines are spawned:
      - **Click goroutine**: Calls the `Click` method to increment the `clicker` and prints `"click"`.
      - **Load goroutine**: Prints the current value of the `clicker` using the `Value` method.
      
  - **Reset logic:**
    - Every time `i % 5 == 0` (i.e., at iterations 0, 5), a new goroutine is spawned to reset the `clicker` value to 0. This is done by calling the `Reset` method.

- **`wg.Wait()`**: After all goroutines are launched, the `main` function waits for all 21 tasks (2 tasks per iteration + 1 reset task every 5 iterations) to complete before the program terminates.

### **Key Concepts and Explanation:**

1. **Atomic Operations:**
   - The `Click`, `Reset`, and `Value` methods are implemented using atomic functions (such as `atomic.AddInt32`, `atomic.StoreInt32`, and `atomic.LoadInt32`). These atomic functions ensure that the operations on the `clicker` are thread-safe, meaning they can be safely accessed and modified by multiple goroutines simultaneously without causing race conditions.

2. **Concurrency:**
   - The program spawns multiple goroutines in the loop. Each iteration launches two goroutines (`Click` and `Load`), and every fifth iteration also spawns a third goroutine to perform a `Reset`.
   - This demonstrates concurrent programming, where multiple tasks are happening at the same time. Each goroutine operates on the shared `clicker` variable, but due to atomic operations, there won't be any race conditions or inconsistent values.

3. **WaitGroup:**
   - The `sync.WaitGroup` is used to synchronize the completion of all the goroutines. The `wg.Add(21)` ensures that the main function will wait for 21 tasks to finish before it proceeds.
   - Each goroutine calls `wg.Done()` when it completes, and `wg.Wait()` in the main function ensures that the program waits for all the tasks to finish before terminating.

4. **Resetting the Clicker:**
   - Every time the index `i` is divisible by 5, the `clicker` is reset by setting its value to `0`. This demonstrates how you can perform a task (like a reset) after a specific condition (every 5 iterations).

### **Output:**
The output will show a series of `"click"` and `"load"` messages, followed by the `"reset"` message every time `i` is a multiple of 5. The value printed by the `"load"` message will reflect the current state of the `clicker`, which is incremented by the `Click` goroutines and reset every 5th iteration.

For example:
```
click
load 1
click
load 2
click
load 3
click
load 4
click
load 5
reset
click
load 1
...
```

### **Conclusion:**
This program showcases how to safely manage concurrent access to a shared variable (`clicker`) using **atomic operations** in Go. It also uses **goroutines** for concurrent execution and a **WaitGroup** to synchronize the completion of all tasks. The program also demonstrates how to reset the counter after every 5 iterations.
