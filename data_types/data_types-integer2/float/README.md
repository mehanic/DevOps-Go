This Go program demonstrates how to implement **atomic operations** on a **float64** type using **atomic functions**, **goroutines**, and **a `sync.WaitGroup`** to handle concurrency. The program safely increments a floating-point value in multiple goroutines while ensuring no race conditions occur. Let’s go through it step-by-step:

### **Explanation of Code:**

#### **1. The `f64` type and associated functions:**
```go
type f64 uint64
```
- A custom type `f64` is created as an alias for the `uint64` type. This is done to enable atomic operations on floating-point numbers (`float64`), since Go’s `atomic` package only supports atomic operations on integer types like `uint64`, `int32`, etc. `float64` values are represented as `uint64` under the hood using their **bit-level representation**.

#### **2. Conversion Functions:**
```go
func uf(u uint64) (f float64) { return math.Float64frombits(u) }
func fu(f float64) (u uint64) { return math.Float64bits(f) }
```
- **`uf(u uint64)`** converts a `uint64` (bit-level representation) into a `float64` value.
- **`fu(f float64)`** converts a `float64` into its `uint64` bit-level representation. These functions are necessary to enable atomic operations on `float64` values.

#### **3. The `Load` method:**
```go
func (f *f64) Load() float64 {
	return uf(atomic.LoadUint64((*uint64)(f)))
}
```
- The `Load` method loads the current `float64` value atomically. It converts the `uint64` stored in the `f64` type back to a `float64` using the `uf` function. 
- `atomic.LoadUint64` ensures that the value is loaded safely, avoiding race conditions.

#### **4. The `Store` method:**
```go
func (f *f64) Store(s float64) {
	atomic.StoreUint64((*uint64)(f), fu(s))
}
```
- The `Store` method stores a `float64` value atomically by converting it into its `uint64` representation using the `fu` function and then calling `atomic.StoreUint64`.
- This ensures that the value is stored without race conditions.

#### **5. The `newF64` function:**
```go
func newF64(f float64) *f64 {
	v := f64(fu(f))
	return &v
}
```
- The `newF64` function creates a new `f64` value, stores the bit-level representation of a `float64` value, and returns a pointer to the newly created `f64`.

#### **6. The `Add` method:**
```go
func (f *f64) Add(s float64) float64 {
	for {
		old := f.Load()
		new := old + s
		if f.CompareAndSwap(old, new) {
			return new
		}
	}
}
```
- The `Add` method atomically adds a value `s` to the current value of `f64`.
- It follows the **Compare-and-Swap (CAS)** technique. The process:
  - Loads the current value (`old`).
  - Computes the new value (`old + s`).
  - Attempts to atomically update the value from `old` to `new` using the `CompareAndSwap` method. If successful, it returns the new value.
  - If the value has changed since it was loaded (indicating a race condition), it retries the operation.

#### **7. The `CompareAndSwap` method:**
```go
func (f *f64) CompareAndSwap(old, new float64) bool {
	return atomic.CompareAndSwapUint64((*uint64)(f), fu(old), fu(new))
}
```
- The `CompareAndSwap` method performs an atomic compare-and-swap operation on the `f64` value.
- It converts `old` and `new` values to their `uint64` representations and uses `atomic.CompareAndSwapUint64` to ensure the update is done atomically. If the value has not changed (i.e., it matches `old`), it is updated to `new`. If the value has been modified by another goroutine in the meantime, it returns `false`, and the caller will retry.

#### **8. The `main` function:**
```go
func main() {
	f := newF64(0.54)
	wg := sync.WaitGroup{}
	// 2*iteration + reset at 5
	wg.Add(20)
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		go func() {
			f.Add(0.01)
			fmt.Println("add")
			wg.Done()
		}()
		go func() {
			fmt.Println("load", f.Load())
			wg.Done()
		}()
	}
	wg.Wait()
}
```
- In the `main` function:
  - A new `f64` value `f` is initialized with `0.54`.
  - A `sync.WaitGroup` (`wg`) is used to wait for the completion of 20 tasks (each goroutine calls `wg.Done()`).
  - Inside the loop (which runs 10 times), two goroutines are created:
    1. **Add goroutine**: Calls `f.Add(0.01)` to add `0.01` to the value of `f` atomically, and prints `"add"`.
    2. **Load goroutine**: Calls `f.Load()` to print the current value of `f` atomically.
  - The program waits for all 20 tasks (10 iterations * 2 tasks per iteration) to complete using `wg.Wait()`.

### **Key Concepts and Explanation:**

1. **Atomic Operations on `float64`:**
   - The key innovation in this program is how atomic operations are applied to a `float64` value. Go’s `atomic` package only supports atomic operations on integer types (`int32`, `uint64`, etc.), but this program works around that limitation by storing the `float64` value as a `uint64` (its bit-level representation) and using atomic operations on it.

2. **Compare-and-Swap (CAS) for Safe Concurrent Updates:**
   - The `Add` method uses the **Compare-and-Swap (CAS)** technique to ensure that the floating-point value is updated atomically. This prevents race conditions when multiple goroutines try to modify the value concurrently.

3. **Concurrency with Goroutines:**
   - The program launches multiple goroutines (10 iterations × 2 goroutines each = 20 goroutines). Each goroutine either adds to the value or loads the value. The atomic operations ensure that these concurrent operations are safe.

4. **Synchronization with `sync.WaitGroup`:**
   - A `sync.WaitGroup` is used to wait for all goroutines to complete before the main function exits. `wg.Add(20)` sets up the expectation for 20 goroutines, and each goroutine calls `wg.Done()` when it completes. The `main` function then calls `wg.Wait()` to block until all tasks are done.

### **Expected Output:**
The program will print `"add"` from the add operations and `"load <value>"` from the load operations. The value printed by `"load"` will reflect the current value of `f`, which is atomically modified by the `Add` operations.

For example, the output might look like:
```
load 0.540000
add
load 0.550000
add
load 0.560000
...
```

### **Conclusion:**
This program demonstrates **safe concurrent access** to a floating-point value in Go using **atomic operations**. It provides an example of how to use `atomic` functions to manage `float64` values, apply **compare-and-swap** for updates, and handle concurrency with multiple goroutines while ensuring thread safety.
