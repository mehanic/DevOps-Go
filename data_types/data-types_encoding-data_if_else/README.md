This Go program demonstrates **steganography** using the `github.com/DimitarPetrov/stegify/steg` package. **Steganography** is the practice of concealing information within other files (like hiding a malicious file inside an image). Let's break down the program and explain the key points:

### **1. Importing Packages:**
```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"github.com/DimitarPetrov/stegify/steg"
)
```
- **`fmt`** is used for formatted I/O, specifically for printing output to the console.
- **`os`** is used to interact with the operating system, particularly to exit the program in case of an error.
- **`github.com/DimitarPetrov/stegify/steg`** is the external package used to perform the steganography operation. This package provides functions to hide and extract data within other files, such as hiding one file inside an image (as in this case).

### **2. Declaring File Names:**
```go
carrierFile := "hulk.jpg"         // File Name Where You Use To Hide
MaliciousFile := "captain.jpg"    // File Name What You Use To Hide
encodedFile := "encoded_hulk.jpg" // Result
```
- **`carrierFile`** refers to the image file where you want to hide the data (in this case, `hulk.jpg`).
- **`MaliciousFile`** refers to the file you want to hide inside the `carrierFile` (in this case, `captain.jpg`).
- **`encodedFile`** is the name of the resulting file that will contain the hidden data, which in this case is `encoded_hulk.jpg`.

### **3. Calling the Encoding Function:**
```go
err := steg.EncodeByFileNames(carrierFile, MaliciousFile, encodedFile)
```
- **`steg.EncodeByFileNames()`** is a function from the `stegify` package that encodes one file (the `MaliciousFile`) inside another (the `carrierFile`). 
- The function takes **three arguments**:
  1. **`carrierFile`**: The file to "hide" the data in (the "cover file"). In this case, `hulk.jpg`.
  2. **`MaliciousFile`**: The file that will be hidden within the carrier file. Here, it is `captain.jpg`.
  3. **`encodedFile`**: The resulting file that will contain the hidden data. This is the final output file that has both the carrier data (the image) and the hidden data (the `captain.jpg` file).

- The `EncodeByFileNames` function will perform the encoding process and return an error if something goes wrong.

### **4. Handling Errors:**
```go
if err != nil {
	fmt.Println(err)
	os.Exit(1)
} else {
	fmt.Println("***File Has Been Succesfully Encoded***")
}
```
- **`if err != nil`** checks if there was an error while encoding. If there is an error (e.g., if the file doesn't exist or the encoding fails), it will print the error message and exit the program using `os.Exit(1)`.
- If there is **no error**, it will print a success message: `"***File Has Been Successfully Encoded***"` to indicate that the encoding process was successful.

### **What Happens During the Encoding Process?**
- The function `EncodeByFileNames` hides the contents of `MaliciousFile` (`captain.jpg`) inside `carrierFile` (`hulk.jpg`).
- This is achieved by manipulating the binary data of the image in such a way that the data of the malicious file is embedded in the carrier file, but it remains **invisible** when you view the image normally.
- The result is saved to `encoded_hulk.jpg`, which appears to be a regular image when opened but contains the hidden file (`captain.jpg`).

### **Summary:**
This Go program:
1. Hides a file (`captain.jpg`) inside an image (`hulk.jpg`) using the `stegify` package.
2. Saves the result to a new file (`encoded_hulk.jpg`).
3. Handles any potential errors that may occur during the encoding process and prints a success message if the operation is successful.

### **Example Workflow:**
1. **Input files**: You start with two files:
   - A carrier image `hulk.jpg`
   - A malicious file (which you want to hide) `captain.jpg`
2. **Encoding**: The program hides the contents of `captain.jpg` inside `hulk.jpg`, and the result is stored in `encoded_hulk.jpg`.
3. **Output file**: The output file (`encoded_hulk.jpg`) can still be opened as a normal image, but it secretly contains the `captain.jpg` file, hidden from the viewer.

This process of hiding files inside images is a form of **steganography**, which is commonly used in cybersecurity (for hiding malicious data) and privacy (to conceal sensitive information).
