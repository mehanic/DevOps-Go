In Go, the `type` keyword is used to define a **new type alias** or **custom type** based on an existing type. Here's an explanation of the code and the rules behind it:

### Code Explanation:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Type Alias:")
    type ByteSize int64 // Type alias definition
    var x ByteSize = 1024 // Variable declaration using the alias
    fmt.Println("x=", x) // Print the value of the variable
}
```

### Breakdown:

1. **Type Alias Definition:**
   ```go
   type ByteSize int64
   ```
   - This line defines a new type alias `ByteSize` based on the existing type `int64`.
   - **What is a Type Alias?**
     - A type alias allows you to define a **new name** for an existing type.
     - `ByteSize` is a new name for the `int64` type, but it is not a **new** underlying type. It is just a different name that is treated as an `int64` in the code.
     - The alias does not create a distinct type from `int64`; it just provides a new name to make the code more readable or meaningful in specific contexts.
     - For example, `ByteSize` can be used to represent byte sizes (like memory or file size) more clearly, while still being an `int64`.

2. **Variable Declaration:**
   ```go
   var x ByteSize = 1024
   ```
   - Here, we declare a variable `x` of type `ByteSize` and assign it the value `1024`.
   - Even though `ByteSize` is just an alias for `int64`, we can use it in the same way as `int64`. 
   - This line is equivalent to writing `var x int64 = 1024`, but using the `ByteSize` alias makes the code more semantically meaningful (e.g., you can now explicitly represent byte sizes).

3. **Printing the Value:**
   ```go
   fmt.Println("x=", x)
   ```
   - This prints the value of `x` to the console. The output will be `x= 1024`, as `x` is of type `ByteSize` (which is just an alias for `int64`).

### Key Points:
- **Alias vs. New Type:** 
   - A **type alias** does not create a new, distinct type; it simply gives an existing type a new name. In this case, `ByteSize` is just another name for `int64`.
   - If you wanted to create a **new type** with its own methods or behavior, you would define a new type (not just an alias), for example:
     ```go
     type ByteSize int64
     func (b ByteSize) String() string {
         return fmt.Sprintf("%d bytes", b)
     }
     ```

- **Why Use Type Aliases?**
   - **Code Clarity:** When the type has a specific meaning in a certain context, using a type alias makes the code more readable. In this case, `ByteSize` clearly indicates that the number represents a size in bytes, as opposed to a regular integer.
   - **Maintainability:** If you later need to change the type from `int64` to another numeric type (like `float64`), you can do it by modifying just the alias definition, rather than updating every instance of that type throughout the code.

### Output:
```
x= 1024
```

### Conclusion:
- The `type ByteSize int64` defines an alias `ByteSize` for the existing `int64` type.
- The variable `x` is declared with the `ByteSize` alias and assigned a value of `1024`.
- The `ByteSize` alias can be used anywhere `int64` is valid, but it provides a more meaningful context for representing byte sizes.
