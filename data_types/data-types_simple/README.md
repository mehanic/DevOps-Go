This Go program demonstrates how to **integrate C code with Go using CGO** (C-Go interoperability). Let's break it down step by step:

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **C Code Block (inside the `import "C"` block)**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void customPrint(char* s) {
    printf("%s\n", s);
}
```
- This is a **C code block** embedded directly in the Go program using **CGO's special comment syntax** `/* ... */`.
- The C function `customPrint` is defined, which takes a **C-style string (`char*`)** and prints it using `printf`.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Importing "C" in Go**
```go
import "C"
```
- The special `C` package allows **calling C functions and using C data types in Go**.
- This allows Go code to interact with C libraries and functions.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Go Code: Creating a C String**
```go
s := C.CString(`Printing to stdout with CGO
Using <stdio.h> and <stdlib.h>`)
```
- `C.CString` converts a Go string to a **C-compatible null-terminated string (`char*`)**.
- The input string is **multi-line**, but Go handles it fine.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Freeing the Memory (Using `defer`)**
```go
defer C.free(unsafe.Pointer(s))
```
- `C.CString` **allocates memory on the C heap**, so **manual memory management is required**.
- `C.free` is used to **free the memory** after the function completes.
- `defer` ensures that `C.free` is called automatically when `main()` finishes executing.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Calling the C Function**
```go
C.customPrint(s)
```
- The **C function `customPrint` is called**, passing the C string `s` as an argument.
- This function prints the string using `printf`.

---

## ‚úÖ **Output:**
```
Printing to stdout with CGO
Using <stdio.h> and <stdlib.h>
```

---

## üéØ **Key Concepts:**
1. **CGO Integration** allows calling C code directly in Go.
2. **C.CString()** converts a Go string to a C-compatible string (`char*`).
3. **Memory Management** is manual when working with the C heap.
4. **`unsafe.Pointer`** is used to bridge between Go and C data types.
5. **Using `defer`** ensures memory is freed after execution.
