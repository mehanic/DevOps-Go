### Code Explanation:

This Go code demonstrates error handling using two different error packages (`errors` from the standard library and `github.com/pkg/errors`), and it shows how to add stack traces and additional context to errors. Let's break it down:

---

### 1. **Error Creation Using the Standard Library (`errors`):**

```go
var errInternal = stderrors.New("ooops, an error on level 1")
```
- Here, `stderrors.New` (which is an alias for `errors.New`) is used to create an error (`errInternal`). This error represents a simple error message: `"ooops, an error on level 1"`.
- The `stderrors` alias is used to avoid confusion with the `errors` package from `github.com/pkg/errors`, which is also used in the code.

---

### 2. **Recursive Function to Generate a Deep Error:**

```go
func GimmeDeepError(depth int) error {
	if depth == 1 {
		return errors.WithStack(errInternal)
	}
	return errors.WithMessagef(GimmeDeepError(depth-1), "error happened on level %d", depth)
}
```

- `GimmeDeepError` is a recursive function that generates an error and adds additional context to it based on the `depth` value.
- **Base Case (when `depth == 1`):**
  - When the function reaches the base case (i.e., `depth == 1`), it simply returns the `errInternal` error but **wraps it** with a stack trace using `errors.WithStack(errInternal)` from the `github.com/pkg/errors` package.
  - `errors.WithStack` adds a stack trace to the error, which can be very useful for debugging, as it tells you the sequence of function calls that led to the error.
  
- **Recursive Case:**
  - For all other depths, the function recursively calls `GimmeDeepError(depth-1)`, which generates an error for the next level, and then it adds an additional message to the error using `errors.WithMessagef`.
  - `errors.WithMessagef` wraps the error returned by the recursive call with a new message that includes the current `depth` value. The format is: `"error happened on level %d"`, where `%d` is replaced by the current `depth`.

- This means that each level of the recursive function adds more context to the error, while also retaining the previous errors and stack traces.

---

### 3. **The Main Function:**

```go
func main() {
	fmt.Printf("%+v", GimmeDeepError(5))
}
```

- The `main` function calls `GimmeDeepError(5)`, which generates an error with a depth of 5. This means the function will call itself recursively 5 times before returning the final error with all the wrapped error messages.
- `fmt.Printf("%+v", GimmeDeepError(5))` prints the final error, using the `"%+v"` format specifier.
  - The `%+v` format specifier tells `fmt.Printf` to print the error message **including the stack trace** (if any). Since the errors are wrapped using `errors.WithStack` and `errors.WithMessagef`, the output will show the full chain of error messages, along with the stack trace of where the error occurred at the base level.

---

### 4. **How the Stack Trace and Messages Appear:**

The result of running `GimmeDeepError(5)` will be a chain of errors, each wrapped with more context, and with a stack trace attached at the base error (`errInternal`).

### Example Output (with stack trace):

```
error happened on level 5: error happened on level 4: error happened on level 3: error happened on level 2: ooops, an error on level 1
github.com/pkg/errors.(*stack).Format(0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0)
...
```

- The printed output will show the entire chain of errors starting from `level 5` to `level 1`.
- The final error message is the root cause (`errInternal`), and it is wrapped with the error messages from each level.
- The stack trace will also be displayed for the base error (`errInternal`), showing where the error was first generated (which is very helpful for debugging).

---

### Key Concepts and Rules:

1. **Error Wrapping with Additional Context:**
   - `errors.WithMessagef` is used to add context to an error by appending a formatted message.
   - `errors.WithStack` is used to wrap an error with a stack trace, which provides information about where the error originated.

2. **Recursive Error Wrapping:**
   - The `GimmeDeepError` function demonstrates how you can recursively add more context to an error as it propagates up through function calls. This is useful for tracking the flow of errors across different levels of function calls.
   - Each recursion adds more context about where the error happened in the call stack.

3. **Stack Traces for Debugging:**
   - The `errors.WithStack` method adds a stack trace to the error. This is essential when debugging because it allows you to see the exact path of function calls that led to the error.
   
4. **Using `github.com/pkg/errors` Package:**
   - The `github.com/pkg/errors` package is often used in Go for more sophisticated error handling. It provides additional features compared to the standard `errors` package, such as adding stack traces (`WithStack`) and attaching context to errors (`WithMessagef`).

5. **Error Chain:**
   - The errors are chained together using `errors.WithMessagef`, meaning that the original error (`errInternal`) is wrapped with multiple layers of context as the recursion deepens. This allows you to trace the error back through all the layers that led to the failure.

### Conclusion:

This code demonstrates how to use error wrapping, stack traces, and recursion to create detailed and informative errors in Go. By leveraging the `github.com/pkg/errors` package, the code adds both context and stack traces to errors, which can significantly improve the debugging process, especially when dealing with deep error chains in complex applications.
