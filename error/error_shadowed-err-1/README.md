In this Go program, there are several important concepts related to error handling, variable shadowing, and the way functions return errors. Let's break it down to explain the rules and behavior:

### Code Breakdown:

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

var ErrInvalidUserID = errors.New("invalid user id")

type UserID string

type User struct {
	ID UserID
}

//nolint:typecheck
func SaveUser(u User) (err error) {
	if !isValidID(u.ID) {
		err := fmt.Errorf("%w: %v", ErrInvalidUserID, u.ID) // err is shadowed during return
		return
	}

	return saveUser(u)
}

func isValidID(id UserID) bool {
	return false
}

func saveUser(u User) error {
	return nil
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(SaveUser(User{ID: "XXX"}))
}
```

### Key Concepts and Rules:

#### 1. **Shadowing of Variables**:
   - In the function `SaveUser`, there is an **error shadowing** issue. The function signature defines a named return variable `err`:
   
     ```go
     func SaveUser(u User) (err error)
     ```
     
     Inside the function, the `err` variable is re-declared (shadowed) with a new local variable:
     
     ```go
     err := fmt.Errorf("%w: %v", ErrInvalidUserID, u.ID)
     ```
     
     This **shadows** the `err` variable from the function signature. The local `err` is not the same as the named return variable, and its scope is limited to that block. This can lead to confusion since the `err` variable within the function will be discarded when returning, and the **original named `err`** from the function signature will be returned instead.

     **Effect**:
     - The shadowed `err` variable is never returned. The function ends by returning the named `err` (which is empty, because it wasn't modified in the function body).
     
#### 2. **Using `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` for Error Wrapping**:
   - In the function `SaveUser`, when `isValidID(u.ID)` returns `false`, the error is created using `fmt.Errorf` with the `%w` verb. This verb is used for **error wrapping**, which allows one error to wrap another, so that both errors can be retrieved using the `errors.Unwrap()` function.
   
     ```go
     err := fmt.Errorf("%w: %v", ErrInvalidUserID, u.ID)
     ```
     - `ErrInvalidUserID` is wrapped with the additional context `u.ID`, which can be useful for debugging. However, since this `err` is **shadowed** and never returned, this wrapped error is never actually propagated.
     
#### 3. **Returning the Named Return Variable**:
   - When returning from the `SaveUser` function, if the error is shadowed (as it is in the code), **the named return variable `err` is returned**. Since the shadowed `err` is not returned, the named return `err` remains `nil` (because it was not modified earlier).
   - The `return` statement does **not** include any error value, meaning `nil` is returned from the `SaveUser` function in case the `isValidID(u.ID)` check fails.
   
#### 4. **The `isValidID` Function**:
   - The `isValidID` function always returns `false`:
   
     ```go
     func isValidID(id UserID) bool {
         return false
     }
     ```
     - Since `isValidID` always returns `false`, the condition inside `SaveUser` (`if !isValidID(u.ID)`) is always true, causing the error handling block to execute.

#### 5. **The Return from `SaveUser`**:
   - Since the `err` is **shadowed** inside the `if` block and never returned explicitly, and the named return variable `err` is never modified, the function ultimately returns `nil`. This is unexpected behavior, as the intention seems to be to return the wrapped error created by `fmt.Errorf`.
   
   **Key Rule**: **Shadowing variables**â€”In Go, when a variable is re-declared within a function (using `:=`), it **shadows** the named return variable. As a result, the named return variable remains unchanged and `nil` is returned.

#### 6. **Expected Output**:
   - Since `SaveUser` is always going to return `nil` because of the shadowing issue, the output will be:
   
     ```go
     <nil>
     ```
     This is because the error is never returned or propagated from `SaveUser` due to the shadowed variable `err` inside the function.

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Named Return Variables**: The `SaveUser` function has a named return variable (`err`), which allows the function to return an error implicitly at the end of the function.

2. **Variable Shadowing**: The line `err := fmt.Errorf(...)` creates a new local variable `err` that **shadows** the named return variable `err`. As a result, the shadowed `err` is never returned, and the named `err` remains `nil` (the default value for `error`).

3. **Error Wrapping**: Using `%w` in `fmt.Errorf` helps to wrap the original error (`ErrInvalidUserID`) with additional context (e.g., `u.ID`), but since the shadowed `err` is not returned, this wrapping is effectively discarded.

4. **Always Check for Shadowing**: When working with functions that have named return values, avoid shadowing those variables inside the function. If you re-declare a variable using `:=` inside a function, it will not affect the named return value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

5. **Fixing Shadowing**: To avoid the shadowing problem, use the assignment `=` (instead of `:=`) to modify the named return variable, like so:
   
   ```go
   err = fmt.Errorf("%w: %v", ErrInvalidUserID, u.ID)
   ```

   This way, the error is correctly returned from the function.

### Conclusion:
The main rule here is to **avoid shadowing** named return variables with `:=`, as it leads to confusing behavior where the intended error is never returned. Use `=` for assignment to modify the named return variable.
