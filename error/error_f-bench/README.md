The code you've provided is a **Go benchmark test** used to compare the performance of `errors.New` and `fmt.Errorf` for creating error values. Let's break down the rules and the details behind this code:

### Code Explanation

#### 1. **Package Declaration and Imports:**
```go
package errorfbench

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"testing"
)
```
- The package is named `errorfbench`, which likely indicates it is focused on benchmarking error creation.
- The standard libraries `errors`, `fmt`, and `testing` are imported:
  - `errors.New` creates a new error with a string message.
  - `fmt.Errorf` is used to create a formatted error.
  - `testing` is used to define benchmarks for performance comparison.

#### 2. **Global Variable `ErrGlobal`:**
```go
var ErrGlobal error
```
- `ErrGlobal` is a global variable of type `error`.
- This global variable is exported (with a capitalized first letter) to prevent certain compiler optimizations. Specifically, it is used in the benchmarks to ensure that the error value is actually used and not optimized away by the compiler (which could happen if it's not referenced).

#### 3. **Benchmarking `errors.New`:**
```go
func BenchmarkErrorsNew(b *testing.B) {
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		ErrGlobal = errors.New("invalid token")
	}
}
```
- `BenchmarkErrorsNew` benchmarks the performance of `errors.New("invalid token")`.
  - `errors.New` is a simple function that creates a new error with a specified message (in this case, `"invalid token"`).
  - The loop runs `b.N` times, where `b.N` is automatically set by the testing framework to ensure a significant number of iterations for a proper benchmark (this number increases with multiple iterations for better statistical accuracy).
  - The `ErrGlobal` is assigned the error returned by `errors.New("invalid token")` in each iteration.
  
#### 4. **Benchmarking `fmt.Errorf`:**
```go
func BenchmarkErrorf(b *testing.B) {
	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
		ErrGlobal = fmt.Errorf("invalid token")
	}
}
```
- `BenchmarkErrorf` benchmarks the performance of `fmt.Errorf("invalid token")`.
  - `fmt.Errorf` creates an error using a formatted string. While `fmt.Errorf` is often used to format more complex strings, here it's simply used with a constant string `"invalid token"`.
  - Similar to the previous benchmark, the loop runs `b.N` times, and `ErrGlobal` is assigned the error returned by `fmt.Errorf("invalid token")` in each iteration.

### Key Points of Benchmark:

- **Goal:** The goal of this benchmark is to compare the performance of `errors.New` and `fmt.Errorf` when creating simple error messages.
  - `errors.New` is more lightweight and simpler when just creating a static error message.
  - `fmt.Errorf` is more flexible and allows for formatting the string, but it might have some overhead due to string formatting, even in the case of static strings.

- **Global Variable (`ErrGlobal`):** This is used to prevent the compiler from optimizing away the created errors. If you don't use the result of `errors.New` or `fmt.Errorf`, the compiler might optimize away the error creation because it sees no side effect. By assigning the result to `ErrGlobal`, the benchmark ensures that the error is "used" and the compiler doesn't eliminate the call to these functions.

- **Benchmarking Mechanism:**
  - The `testing.B` object is provided by the testing framework and is used to control the benchmarking loop. 
  - `b.N` is the number of iterations to run, and `b.N` increases to a large number to ensure the benchmark is meaningful (this allows the Go testing framework to average over many iterations to give more accurate results).
  
- **Performance Implications:**
  - **`errors.New`** is typically very fast because it simply creates an error from a string literal without additional processing or formatting.
  - **`fmt.Errorf`** generally has a little more overhead because it involves formatting a string, even though in this case the string doesn't change. This extra processing makes `fmt.Errorf` potentially slower than `errors.New` for simple error creation.

### Output of the Benchmark:
When you run the benchmark with `go test -bench .`, the results will show how many iterations each benchmark completed per second for both functions (`errors.New` and `fmt.Errorf`). This allows you to compare their relative performance.

### Summary of the Rules and Insights:

1. **Global Variable to Prevent Optimization:**
   - The `ErrGlobal` variable is used to prevent the compiler from optimizing away the created errors in the benchmark. If an error creation is not used, the compiler might discard it entirely, leading to inaccurate benchmarks.

2. **Benchmark Loop:**
   - The `b.N` loop in the benchmarks runs a number of iterations determined by the `testing` framework to ensure statistically significant results. It gives a good indication of how many times each function can execute in a second.

3. **Error Creation Functions:**
   - `errors.New`: A simple, low-overhead function for creating errors with a fixed message.
   - `fmt.Errorf`: More flexible, allows formatted error creation, but may have a higher overhead due to string formatting.

4. **Performance Comparison:**
   - `errors.New` is typically faster than `fmt.Errorf` because it doesn't perform any string formatting.
   - `fmt.Errorf` can be slower due to the formatting logic, even if the format string is constant.

This benchmark is useful for measuring the relative performance of different error creation techniques in Go.
