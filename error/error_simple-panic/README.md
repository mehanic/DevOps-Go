In the provided Go program, we are dealing with a concept called **panic**. Let's break down how panic works and explain the rules demonstrated in the code:

### Code Breakdown

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {

	// Line that causes the panic
	panic("Do panic")

	// This line will not be executed
	fmt.Print("This code will not be executed")

	// Panic caused by accessing a non-existent array index, uncomment the code
	// arr := [5]int{}
	// arr[10] = 100
}
```

### Key Concepts and Rules:

1. **Panic**:
   - `panic` is a built-in function in Go that stops the normal execution of a program. It is used to indicate that something unexpected or unrecoverable has occurred, often used for severe errors like invalid states, impossible conditions, etc.
   - When `panic` is called, the program stops execution immediately, and the control is transferred to the deferred functions (if any). The program will then exit after printing the panic message.

   In this case, `panic("Do panic")` is called. This results in the program halting execution with the message `"Do panic"`. 

2. **Code After Panic Will Not Execute**:
   - After calling `panic("Do panic")`, the program's execution is immediately halted. The line `fmt.Print("This code will not be executed")` will never be executed.
   - This is a key characteristic of panic. When a `panic` occurs, the program will terminate unless it is recovered using a `defer` statement with a `recover()` function.

3. **Array Index Out of Range (Commented Out)**:
   - The commented-out section demonstrates another way of causing a panic: by accessing an out-of-range index in an array.
   
     ```go
     // arr := [5]int{}
     // arr[10] = 100
     ```
   
   - In this case, trying to assign a value to `arr[10]` (which is beyond the bounds of the array `arr` with a size of 5) would cause a runtime panic with a message like:
     ```
     panic: runtime error: index out of range [10] with length 5
     ```
   - Go arrays have fixed sizes, and accessing an index outside the range of the array will trigger a panic.

4. **Deferred Functions and Panic Recovery (Not Used in This Example)**:
   - **Panic recovery**: If you want to handle the panic and allow the program to continue, you can use the `defer` and `recover` functions. `defer` schedules a function to run after the function that called it completes (even if a panic occurs). `recover` is used inside a deferred function to capture and handle a panic.
   
   Example:
   ```go
   func main() {
       defer func() {
           if r := recover(); r != nil {
               fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:", r)
           }
       }()
       
       panic("This will panic!")
   }
   ```
   In the above example, `recover()` would catch the panic and print a message instead of terminating the program.

### Summary of Rules in This Example:

1. **`panic()` halts the execution of the program immediately**: Once a `panic` occurs, the program stops running and any subsequent code is not executed.
   
2. **Runtime panic due to array index out of range**: Accessing an invalid index in an array (e.g., `arr[10]` for an array of size 5) will trigger a panic due to an out-of-bounds index.

3. **Unreachable code after `panic()`**: Any code that follows a `panic` call will be skipped and not executed.

### Conclusion:

- `panic()` is a way to abruptly stop program execution when an unexpected condition occurs.
- The example shows how using `panic()` will prevent any further code execution and how accessing an invalid array index can also lead to a panic.
