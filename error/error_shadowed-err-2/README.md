In this Go program, the focus is on handling errors properly using the `return` mechanism, and managing error handling in a nested fashion. Let's break down the rules demonstrated in the code:

### Code Breakdown:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
)

func Handle() (err error) {
	if err = handleConn(); err != nil {
		// Новая ошибка не перетирает возвращаемую.
		// Попробуйте заменить `:=` на `=`.
		if err := closeConn(); err != nil {
			log.Println(err)
		}
	}
	return
}

func handleConn() error {
	return fmt.Errorf("handle conn error")
}

func closeConn() error {
	return fmt.Errorf("close error")
}

func main() {
	fmt.Println(Handle())
}
```

### Key Concepts and Rules:

#### 1. **Returning Named Errors from Functions**:
   - The `Handle` function is defined with a **named return variable** `err`. This allows the function to return an error at the end, without needing to explicitly write `return err` at the end.
   
     ```go
     func Handle() (err error) {
         // Function code...
         return
     }
     ```
   - When `return` is used without specifying an argument, it returns the value of the named return variable (`err` in this case).

#### 2. **Assignment (`=`) vs Short Declaration (`:=`)**:
   - Inside the `Handle` function, there's a conditional block that checks for an error after calling `handleConn()`:
   
     ```go
     if err = handleConn(); err != nil {
     ```
     This line is important because:
     - The **`err = handleConn()`** assignment checks if `handleConn()` returns an error and stores it in the named return variable `err`.
     - The error returned by `handleConn()` is stored in the `err` variable, and then the function proceeds to the next block.
   
   - Inside the nested `if` block, there's another error handling for the `closeConn()` function:
   
     ```go
     if err := closeConn(); err != nil {
     ```
     - Here, the **`err := closeConn()`** creates a **new local variable** `err` within the scope of the nested block. This is a **short variable declaration** and **shadows** the named `err` from the outer scope.
     - **Important**: This `err` does not affect the named `err` variable in the outer scope. The error from `closeConn()` is logged, but it does not overwrite the error from `handleConn()`.

#### 3. **Shadowing Local Variables**:
   - The key takeaway from the comment in the code is that the **local error variable** created by `:=` (in the line `if err := closeConn(); err != nil {`) does not overwrite the named `err` variable that was used earlier in the `Handle` function.
   
     ```go
     if err := closeConn(); err != nil {
         log.Println(err)
     }
     ```
     - This local `err` only exists within this inner block. The error that is printed by `log.Println(err)` is from `closeConn()` (`"close error"`), but this does not affect the outer `err`.
     - The outer `err` (which holds `"handle conn error"`) remains unchanged and will be returned by the `Handle` function.

#### 4. **Error Logging**:
   - Inside the inner block, if `closeConn()` returns an error, the program logs it using `log.Println(err)`. This will output `"close error"` to the log.
   
   - However, even if `closeConn()` fails, the original error from `handleConn()` will still be returned by the `Handle` function.

#### 5. **Returning the Original Error**:
   - After all the error handling, the `Handle` function reaches the `return` statement without explicitly specifying the return value, so the **named return variable `err`** is returned.
   - Since `err` was assigned the value of `handleConn()` earlier (and `handleConn()` returned `"handle conn error"`), the returned value is `"handle conn error"`, even though the `"close error"` was logged.

#### 6. **Output**:
   - The output of this program is:
   
     ```
     2021/07/10 11:58:53 close error
     handle conn error
     ```
   - `"close error"` is logged when the error occurs in the `closeConn()` function.
   - `"handle conn error"` is returned from the `Handle` function, which is printed by `fmt.Println(Handle())`.

### Summary of Key Rules:

1. **Named Return Variables**: Named return variables, such as `err` in `Handle()`, allow you to implicitly return the error value without needing to explicitly specify `return err` at the end of the function.

2. **Assignment (`=`) vs Short Declaration (`:=`)**: Using `=` assigns a value to an existing variable (in this case, `err`), while `:=` creates a new local variable. In this case, the inner `:=` for `err` does not overwrite the outer `err`, effectively shadowing it in the inner scope.

3. **Error Handling with Multiple Steps**: Even if an error occurs at a later stage in the process (e.g., `closeConn()`), the error from the earlier operation (`handleConn()`) can still be returned.

4. **Logging and Returning Errors**: Errors can be logged at intermediate steps without affecting the final returned error value, which allows for more granular logging without interfering with the function's final result.

### Conclusion:
In this code, the error from `handleConn()` is returned from the `Handle()` function, while the error from `closeConn()` is only logged, and does not overwrite the original error. The key takeaway is understanding how shadowing works in Go and how the `:=` operator behaves differently from `=` when working with variables.
