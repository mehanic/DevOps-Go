The provided code demonstrates an issue when using the `%w` verb with `fmt.Errorf` to wrap a `nil` value. Let's break down the code and explain the rules behind it.

### Code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	err := fmt.Errorf("cannot do operation: %w", nil)
	fmt.Println(err)        // cannot do operation: %!w(<nil>)
	fmt.Println(err == nil) // false
}
```

### Explanation:

#### 1. **The `%w` Verb in `fmt.Errorf`:**
- The `%w` verb is used in `fmt.Errorf` to **wrap an existing error** into a new error. This verb is designed specifically for **wrapping errors** so that you can use functions like `errors.Is` or `errors.As` to check for specific errors later on.

#### 2. **Passing `nil` to `%w`:**
- The critical issue in this code is passing `nil` as the argument to the `%w` verb.
- The `%w` verb expects an **error type**, but `nil` does not fulfill this requirement in a meaningful way when used with `%w`. Although `nil` is a valid value, it is not an error itself (i.e., `nil` is not of the type `error`).
- When you use `%w` with `nil`, Go doesn't know how to wrap it as an error. As a result, it ends up printing `%!w(<nil>)`, which is the format specifier for wrapping errors that Go can't process correctly in this case.

#### 3. **Resulting Output:**
- **`fmt.Println(err)`** outputs: `cannot do operation: %!w(<nil>)`.
  - This is Go's way of saying that it failed to wrap the `nil` value as an error using `%w`. The `%!w(<nil>)` indicates that the `%w` verb could not process the `nil` value properly, leading to a formatting error.

- **`fmt.Println(err == nil)`** outputs: `false`.
  - Here, `err` is a **non-nil error** object, which is a result of the `fmt.Errorf` call (even though it contains the incorrect format `%!w(<nil>)`).
  - Therefore, `err` is **not** equal to `nil` because it holds a non-nil value â€” specifically, the error string created by `fmt.Errorf`.
  - Since the `err` value holds a reference to an error string that says `cannot do operation: %!w(<nil>)`, it is considered a non-nil value, and the comparison with `nil` results in `false`.

#### 4. **Why is `%!w(<nil>)` Printed?**
- When you use the `%w` verb, Go expects that you are passing an actual `error` value to wrap. In your case, `nil` does not implement the `error` interface. Instead of successfully wrapping an error, Go prints `%!w(<nil>)` as part of the string formatting because it cannot process `nil` as an error.
  
#### 5. **The Rule:**
- **Rule for `%w` verb:** The `%w` verb in `fmt.Errorf` expects an **error value** as the argument. If you pass `nil` (which is not an `error`), Go will output a formatting error (`%!w(<nil>)`) because `nil` is not a valid type to wrap with `%w`.

### Correct Usage:

To avoid the formatting error, you should pass an actual error to the `%w` verb. For example:

```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	err := fmt.Errorf("cannot do operation: %w", errors.New("some error"))
	fmt.Println(err)        // cannot do operation: some error
	fmt.Println(err == nil) // false
}
```

In this example, `errors.New("some error")` is passed to `%w`, and `fmt.Errorf` correctly wraps the error, producing a valid result. The output will be:

```
cannot do operation: some error
false
```

### Summary of Rules:

1. **`%w` Verb:** The `%w` verb in `fmt.Errorf` is for wrapping **errors**, not other types like `nil` or strings. It expects an argument of type `error`.
2. **`nil` as an Argument:** Passing `nil` as the argument to `%w` results in a formatting error because `nil` is not of type `error` and cannot be wrapped properly.
3. **Comparison with `nil`:** The error returned by `fmt.Errorf` in this case is **non-nil**, even though it has an incorrect format. Therefore, the comparison `err == nil` is `false`.
