In this code, we are using the `errors.Is` function to compare errors and check if one error is equivalent to another specific error. Let's break down the concepts, rules, and behaviors step by step:

### `errors.Is` and Error Comparison:
The `errors.Is` function is used to check whether an error is **equal to** or **wrapped by** another error. It is primarily used to compare errors and check if a specific error matches an error type that might have been wrapped.

The function signature of `errors.Is` is:

```go
func Is(err, target error) bool
```

Where:
- `err` is the error you're checking.
- `target` is the error you're comparing against.

### Code Walkthrough:
Let's break down each part of the code and explain the rules based on the behavior of `errors.Is` and how error comparison works in Go.

```go
exist := errors.New("file already exists")
fmt.Println(errors.Is(exist, os.ErrExist)) // false
```
- Here, we create a new error `exist` with the message `"file already exists"`.
- We are comparing this error to `os.ErrExist`, which is a specific error from the `os` package that represents the "file already exists" condition.
- **Why is the output `false`?**
  - The reason is that even though `exist` and `os.ErrExist` may represent similar logical conditions (i.e., both suggest that a file already exists), they are **different error instances**. In Go, errors are distinct objects, so they are not considered equal just because their messages are the same.
  - `errors.Is` checks if one error is the same as or wrapped by another error, but since `exist` is not **wrapped** by `os.ErrExist`, the comparison returns `false`.

```go
eof := errors.New("EOF")
fmt.Println(errors.Is(eof, io.EOF)) // false
```
- We create an error `eof` with the message `"EOF"`.
- We are comparing this error to `io.EOF`, which is a predefined error in the `io` package representing the end-of-file condition.
- **Why is the output `false`?**
  - Again, `eof` and `io.EOF` are two distinct error objects. Even though the `eof` error's message might be similar to `"EOF"`, it is a different error object from `io.EOF`.
  - `errors.Is` will return `false` because these are not the same error object, nor is `eof` wrapping `io.EOF`.

```go
noRows := errors.New("no rows in result set")
fmt.Println(errors.Is(noRows, pgx.ErrNoRows)) // false
```
- The error `noRows` represents the message `"no rows in result set"`, and we compare it to `pgx.ErrNoRows`, which is a predefined error from the `pgx` package representing the "no rows" condition in PostgreSQL queries.
- **Why is the output `false`?**
  - `noRows` and `pgx.ErrNoRows` are different error objects. Even though they both represent similar error conditions (i.e., no rows returned from a query), they are not the same error type.
  - As with previous examples, `errors.Is` returns `false` because `noRows` is not the same as `pgx.ErrNoRows`, and they are not wrapped errors either.

```go
fmt.Println(errors.Is(sql.ErrNoRows, pgx.ErrNoRows)) // false
```
- Here, we compare `sql.ErrNoRows`, a predefined error in the `sql` package representing the "no rows" condition, with `pgx.ErrNoRows`, which is the `pgx` package's version of the same error.
- **Why is the output `false`?**
  - Even though both errors represent the same condition (i.e., no rows found in the result set), they belong to different packages (`sql` vs. `pgx`), and they are different error instances.
  - `errors.Is` checks for equality of the errors or if one error wraps the other, but because these errors come from different packages, they are not considered equal.
  - Since they are distinct errors (not wrapped), the result is `false`.

### Key Points:
1. **Error Instances Are Distinct**: In Go, errors are objects, and each error created using `errors.New` is a distinct object in memory. Two errors with the same message or logic may still not be considered equal because they are different instances.

2. **Error Wrapping**: For `errors.Is` to return `true`, one error must either be the exact same error as the target error or be wrapped by the target error. In other words:
   - If you use `fmt.Errorf` with `%w` to wrap an error, `errors.Is` will return `true` if the target error is wrapped within the wrapped error.
   - If two errors are not wrapped or equal, `errors.Is` will return `false`.

3. **Package-Specific Errors**: Errors that come from different packages (like `sql.ErrNoRows` and `pgx.ErrNoRows`) are considered different, even if they represent the same concept. This is why `errors.Is` returns `false` when comparing `sql.ErrNoRows` with `pgx.ErrNoRows`.

### Conclusion:
- The rule here is that **two different error instances, even if they have the same message, are not considered equal unless they are the same error instance or one error wraps the other**.
- `errors.Is` does not perform a message comparison but checks for **error object identity** or **error wrapping**.
