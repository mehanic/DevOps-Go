This Go code snippet demonstrates an important rule related to modifying global variables and the effects it has on error comparisons. Let's break it down step by step:

### Code Breakdown

#### 1. **Initial Error Comparison (Before Mutation):**
```go
err1 := io.EOF
err2 := io.EOF
fmt.Println(io.EOF)       // EOF
fmt.Println(err1 == err2) // true
```

- `err1` and `err2` are both assigned the value of `io.EOF`.
- **`io.EOF`** is a globally defined error in the `io` package (it is a constant of type `error`).
- Initially, `err1` and `err2` both point to the same error value (`io.EOF`), so **`err1 == err2`** evaluates to `true` because they are equal.
- When we print **`io.EOF`**, it displays `EOF`, the string representation of the error.

#### 2. **Mutation of `io.EOF` via the `dirtyhacker` package:**
```go
dirtyhacker.MutateEOF()
```

- The code calls a function **`dirtyhacker.MutateEOF()`**, which presumably modifies the global `io.EOF` error. 
- This function is presumably defined in the `dirtyhacker` package. While the code for `MutateEOF` is not provided, we can infer that this function **modifies the global value of `io.EOF`** (likely setting it to `nil` or some other error).

#### 3. **After Mutation:**
```go
fmt.Println(io.EOF)         // nil
fmt.Println(err1 == io.EOF) // false
```

- After the mutation, the value of **`io.EOF`** is now `nil`, or some other altered value. We can see this in the output:
  - **`io.EOF`** is printed as `nil` (or some mutated value).
- **`err1 == io.EOF`** evaluates to `false` because `err1` still holds the original `io.EOF` value, while `io.EOF` has been changed. As a result, `err1` and `io.EOF` are no longer the same value, and the comparison fails.

### Key Concepts and Rules

1. **Global Variables in Go:**
   - In Go, errors like `io.EOF` are defined as **global variables** within a package. This means they can be accessed from anywhere in the program as `io.EOF`.
   - **Global variables can be modified**, but this comes with risks, especially when dealing with constants or errors. Modifying global variables can cause unexpected behavior in your program, as any part of the program that relies on the original value might see inconsistent or altered behavior.

2. **Changing Global Errors:**
   - The mutation of `io.EOF` in the `dirtyhacker.MutateEOF()` function shows that **global constants or errors** like `io.EOF` are not truly immutable. In the example, the function is designed to change the `io.EOF` error.
   - Once the global error is mutated, it affects the value of `io.EOF` throughout the program. This mutation can cause unexpected results, as demonstrated by the comparison after the mutation (`err1 == io.EOF` being `false`).

3. **Error Comparison:**
   - **Errors in Go are compared by value.** The statement **`err1 == err2`** compares the values of the errors. Before the mutation, both errors were pointing to the same value (`io.EOF`), so the comparison was true. However, after the mutation, `io.EOF` no longer points to the same value, so `err1 == io.EOF` becomes false.
   - This demonstrates that **two errors are only equal if they are pointing to the same underlying value**.

4. **The Danger of Mutating Global Errors:**
   - **Changing a global error like `io.EOF` can lead to unpredictable behavior**, especially when that error is used across different parts of your program. If an error is mutated, any code that uses the original error will get inconsistent results.
   - In this case, after mutating `io.EOF`, any comparison of `err1` with the global `io.EOF` fails because `io.EOF` has been changed globally, and it no longer holds its original value.

### Why This is a Bad Practice

- **Global state modification**: Changing global variables, especially errors, can lead to **non-deterministic behavior** in your program, where different parts of the program might behave differently based on how global variables were altered.
- **Unintended side effects**: The mutation of `io.EOF` can create unintended side effects, where the program logic depends on the original error (`io.EOF`), but after mutation, it gets a different value (`nil` or another error). This can cause bugs that are difficult to track down and debug.
  
In practice, it is often **better to avoid modifying global errors** or other global variables. If you need to change the value of an error, it might be better to define a new variable, or better yet, pass errors explicitly through function parameters, rather than relying on global state.

### Takeaways

- **Do not modify global errors** like `io.EOF`. Once they are defined, they should remain constant throughout the program to avoid confusing behavior.
- **Error comparisons** in Go depend on exact equality, so if a global error is modified, comparisons with that error can fail unexpectedly.
- Mutating global variables can introduce **unintended side effects** that may affect different parts of the program. Avoid changing global variables unless absolutely necessary.
