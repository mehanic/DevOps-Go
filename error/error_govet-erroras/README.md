### **Explanation of the Bug and Rules Violated**

Your Go program has a **critical mistake** in the following line:

```go
if errors.As(err, osErr) { // Казалось бы, уже указатель!
```

This line is **incorrect** because `osErr` is not passed as a pointer to a pointer. This will cause `errors.As()` to panic or fail silently.

---

### **1️⃣ What's Wrong?**
- The `errors.As()` function requires the second argument to be a **pointer to an error interface** so that it can modify it.
- In your code, `osErr` is already declared as a `*os.PathError` (a pointer), but you are **not passing its address**.
- Instead of modifying `osErr`, `errors.As()` will just fail and return `false`.

---

### **2️⃣ Why Does This Happen?**
- **Incorrect usage:**
  ```go
  var osErr *os.PathError
  if errors.As(err, osErr) {  // ❌ Wrong: osErr is nil, not a pointer to a pointer
  ```
  - `osErr` is **nil** at this point.
  - `errors.As()` needs a **pointer to `osErr`** so it can assign a value to it.

- **Correct usage:**
  ```go
  if errors.As(err, &osErr) {  // ✅ Correct: Pass pointer to the pointer
  ```
  - `&osErr` means "a pointer to `osErr`," allowing `errors.As()` to modify `osErr`.

---

### **3️⃣ How to Fix It?**
✅ **Corrected Version:**
```go
func main() {
	var err error
	var osErr *os.PathError
	if errors.As(err, &osErr) { // ✅ Pass pointer to osErr
		fmt.Println(osErr.Path) // Now this line can be reached
	}
}
```

---

### **4️⃣ What Would the Original Code Do?**
Since `osErr` is **nil**, `errors.As(err, osErr)` does nothing, and the condition is **always false**.  
This means **the `fmt.Println(osErr.Path)` statement is never reached**.

### **5️⃣ Expected Output**
Since `err` is `nil`, even after fixing the pointer issue, `errors.As()` will still return `false`, meaning **nothing will be printed**.

If `err` were an `*os.PathError`, the program would work correctly.

---

### **6️⃣ What Rule Does This Violate?**
This mistake is caught by **`govet`**, a Go static analysis tool.

- **Rule:** `govet` warns when a function expects a pointer, but a non-pointer is passed.

**Why?**
- The `errors.As()` function expects a **pointer to a pointer**, but `osErr` was passed incorrectly.

---

### **Final Takeaways**
✅ Always **pass a pointer to the pointer** when using `errors.As()`:
   ```go
   if errors.As(err, &osErr) {  // ✅ Correct usage
   ```

✅ Use **`govet`** or linters to catch this issue early.

✅ Remember: `errors.As()` modifies the second argument, so it **must be a pointer** to allow modification.

---

### **Final Fixed Code**
```go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	var err error
	var osErr *os.PathError
	if errors.As(err, &osErr) { // ✅ Pass pointer to osErr
		fmt.Println(osErr.Path) // ✅ Now this line can be reached
	} else {
		fmt.Println("error is not an *os.PathError")
	}
}
```

### **Expected Output**
```
error is not an *os.PathError
```
(since `err` is `nil`)
