ZooKeeper Deployment with Kafka: The Big Picture
Kafka requires ZooKeeper (unless using KRaft mode in newer versions) to manage:

Cluster membership
Leader election
Topic configurations
The key point:
ZooKeeper does not need to run on every Kafka broker.

Instead, deploy ZooKeeper as a separate, reliable quorum of servers to avoid resource contention and improve stability.

⚙️ Why a Separate ZooKeeper Cluster?
Resource Isolation: Kafka is CPU/IO-intensive. ZooKeeper needs stability for consensus.
High Availability: Running ZooKeeper independently ensures Kafka cluster reliability.
Simplified Maintenance: Restarting Kafka brokers won’t affect ZooKeeper.

🛠️ Step-by-Step Installation
🚀 1️⃣ Install ZooKeeper Cluster
Prerequisites:

3 servers for ZooKeeper: zk1, zk2, zk3
Each machine should have Java 8+ installed.
🖥️ Install ZooKeeper on Each Node
bash
Copy
Edit
# Update and install Java & ZooKeeper
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless -y
wget https://downloads.apache.org/zookeeper/stable/apache-zookeeper-3.7.1-bin.tar.gz
tar -xvzf apache-zookeeper-3.7.1-bin.tar.gz
mv apache-zookeeper-3.7.1-bin /opt/zookeeper
🛠️ Configure ZooKeeper
bash
Copy
Edit
cd /opt/zookeeper/conf
cp zoo_sample.cfg zoo.cfg
🔧 Update zoo.cfg like this (on each ZooKeeper node):

properties
Copy
Edit
# Basic settings
tickTime=2000
initLimit=5
syncLimit=2
dataDir=/var/lib/zookeeper
clientPort=2181

# Ensemble configuration (same for all nodes)
server.1=192.168.1.10:2888:3888
server.2=192.168.1.11:2888:3888
server.3=192.168.1.12:2888:3888
🛠️ Create ZooKeeper Data Directory
bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/zookeeper
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/lib/zookeeper
🏷️ Assign Node IDs
Each ZooKeeper node needs a unique ID:

zk1 → 1
zk2 → 2
zk3 → 3
On zk1:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "1" > /var/lib/zookeeper/myid
On zk2:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "2" > /var/lib/zookeeper/myid
On zk3:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "3" > /var/lib/zookeeper/myid
🚀 Start ZooKeeper
bash
Copy
Edit
cd /opt/zookeeper/bin
./zkServer.sh start
🔍 Verify ZooKeeper Status
bash
Copy
Edit
./zkServer.sh status
Expected output:

Mode: follower or Mode: leader
🛠️ 2️⃣ Configure Kafka to Connect to ZooKeeper
Kafka brokers need to know the ZooKeeper ensemble addresses.

🖥️ Kafka Broker Configuration (server.properties)
properties
Copy
Edit
# ZooKeeper ensemble connection string
zookeeper.connect=192.168.1.10:2181,192.168.1.11:2181,192.168.1.12:2181
Then, restart Kafka brokers:

bash
Copy
Edit
bin/kafka-server-stop.sh
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
🔍 Monitoring & Debugging
🛠️ ZooKeeper Health Check
bash
Copy
Edit
echo "ruok" | nc 192.168.1.10 2181
Expected response:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
imok
🚦 Check ZooKeeper Connections
bash
Copy
Edit
echo "cons" | nc 192.168.1.10 2181
🚧 Best Practices
Deploy ZooKeeper on separate servers from Kafka in production.
Use an odd number of ZooKeeper nodes (e.g., 3, 5, or 7) for quorum.
Monitor ZooKeeper health regularly (mntr, srvr, cons commands).
Optimize networking: ZooKeeper communication requires low latency.
