This Go program loads a JSON file (`tft_champions.json`) containing data about champions and performs various operations to loop over the loaded champions and print details about them. Let's break down the code and the rules demonstrated here.

### **Code Breakdown:**

#### 1. **Defining the Champion Struct:**
```go
type champion struct {
    Name    string   `json:"name"`
    Classes []string `json:"classes"`
    Origins []string `json:"origins"`
    Cost    int      `json:"cost"`
}
```
- The `champion` struct represents each champion's data. 
- It includes the following fields:
  - `Name`: The name of the champion.
  - `Classes`: The classes to which the champion belongs (e.g., Assassin, Warrior).
  - `Origins`: The origins associated with the champion (e.g., Noxus, Ionia).
  - `Cost`: The cost of the champion in the game.

- The struct tags like `json:"name"` are used to map the JSON keys to the Go struct fields. This ensures that the data from the JSON file is correctly unmarshalled into the struct fields.

#### 2. **Loading Champions from the JSON File:**
```go
func loadChampions() ([]champion, error) {
    file, err := os.Open("tft_champions.json")
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    defer file.Close()

    var champions []champion
    for {
        if err := json.NewDecoder(file).Decode(&champions); err == io.EOF {
            break
        } else if err != nil {
            return nil, err
        }
    }

    return champions, nil
}
```
- **Opening the File:**
  - The `os.Open("tft_champions.json")` function is used to open the JSON file. If the file cannot be opened, an error is returned.

- **Decoding JSON:**
  - `json.NewDecoder(file).Decode(&champions)` is used to decode the JSON data into a Go slice of `champion` structs.
  - The loop checks for the `EOF` (end-of-file) error to stop reading. The `json.NewDecoder` helps to process large JSON files efficiently by decoding them in chunks.
  - If any other error occurs during decoding, the function returns the error.

- **Returning the Champions:**
  - Once all champions are decoded, the function returns the slice of `champion` structs (`champions`) and `nil` for error.

#### 3. **Main Function - Loading and Printing Champion Data:**
```go
func main() {
    champions, err := loadChampions()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("An error occurred loading/parsing champions, err=%v", err)
    }
    
    // Loop using index
    for index, champ := range champions {
        log.Printf("%s is at index %d\n", champ.Name, index)
    }

    log.Println("---------------------")
    
    // Loop using champion values
    for _, champ := range champions {
        log.Printf("Champion is %s\n", champ.Name)
    }
    
    log.Println("---------------------")
    
    // Loop using index only
    for index := range champions {
        log.Printf("There is a champion at index %d\n", index)
    }

    log.Println("---------------------")
    
    // Loop using traditional for loop
    for i := 0; i < len(champions); i++ {
        log.Printf("%s is at index %d\n", champions[i].Name, i)
    }

    log.Println("---------------------")
    
    // Loop in reverse order
    for i := len(champions) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
        log.Printf("%s is at index %d\n", champions[i].Name, i)
    }
}
```

- **Load Champions:**
  - The `champions, err := loadChampions()` function call loads the champions from the JSON file.
  - If an error occurs during the loading process, it is logged using `log.Fatalf`, which stops execution.

- **Various Looping Methods:**

  1. **Looping with Index and Value:**
     ```go
     for index, champ := range champions {
         log.Printf("%s is at index %d\n", champ.Name, index)
     }
     ```
     - The `range` keyword is used to loop through the `champions` slice.
     - `index` holds the current index, and `champ` holds the value (the champion struct) at that index.

  2. **Looping with Value Only:**
     ```go
     for _, champ := range champions {
         log.Printf("Champion is %s\n", champ.Name)
     }
     ```
     - This loop uses `range` but ignores the index (`_`), only accessing the `champ` (the champion struct) in each iteration.

  3. **Looping with Index Only:**
     ```go
     for index := range champions {
         log.Printf("There is a champion at index %d\n", index)
     }
     ```
     - This loop uses `range` to get the index but doesn't access the value. It just prints the index.

  4. **Traditional for Loop:**
     ```go
     for i := 0; i < len(champions); i++ {
         log.Printf("%s is at index %d\n", champions[i].Name, i)
     }
     ```
     - A classic `for` loop is used here to iterate over the indices of the `champions` slice. It accesses the champions using `champions[i]`.

  5. **Looping in Reverse Order:**
     ```go
     for i := len(champions) - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
         log.Printf("%s is at index %d\n", champions[i].Name, i)
     }
     ```
     - This loop iterates over the `champions` slice in reverse order, starting from the last index (`len(champions) - 1`) and decrementing the index until it reaches `0`.

### **Expected Output:**

For a sample `tft_champions.json` file with champions like "Akali", "Evelynn", etc., the output would look like this:

```
2024/10/02 21:57:38 Akali is at index 0
2024/10/02 21:57:38 Evelynn is at index 1
2024/10/02 21:57:38 Katarina is at index 2
2024/10/02 21:57:38 Kha'Zix is at index 3
2024/10/02 21:57:38 Pyke is at index 4
2024/10/02 21:57:38 Rengar is at index 5
2024/10/02 21:57:38 Zed is at index 6
2024/10/02 21:57:38 Aatrox is at index 7
2024/10/02 21:57:38 Camille is at index 8
---------------------
Champion is Akali

Champion is Rengar
Champion is Zed
Champion is Aatrox
Champion is Camille
---------------------
There is a champion at index 0
There is a champion at index 1
There is a champion at index 2
There is a champion at index 3

There is a champion at index 5
There is a champion at index 6
There is a champion at index 7

---------------------
Akali is at index 0
Evelynn is at index 1
Katarina is at index 2
Kha'Zix is at index 3
Pyke is at index 4
Rengar is at index 5
Zed is at index 6

Camille is at index 8
---------------------
Camille is at index 8
Aatrox is at index 7
Zed is at index 6
Rengar is at index 5
Pyke is at index 4
Kha'Zix is at index 3
Katarina is at index 2

```

### **Rules Demonstrated:**

1. **Working with JSON:**
   - The `json.NewDecoder(file).Decode(&champions)` is used to decode a JSON file into Go structs. This shows how to read and parse JSON data in Go.

2. **Multiple Ways to Loop Over a Slice:**
   - The program demonstrates several ways to loop over a slice (like `range`, traditional for loops, and looping in reverse order).

3. **Using Log to Print Data:**
   - The program uses `log.Printf` to log information. The log output includes timestamp information by default.

4. **File Handling:**
   - The program handles file opening and closing (`os.Open()` and `defer file.Close()`), ensuring that resources are released properly.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Error handling is used to ensure that the program doesn't proceed with incorrect input or file parsing. If there's an error loading the file, it logs the error and stops the execution.
