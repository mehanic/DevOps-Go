This Go code demonstrates an algorithm for incrementing a number represented as an array of digits. It has two parts:

1. **The `plusOne` function**: This function is designed to take an array of digits (where each digit represents a part of a number) and add one to that number. 
2. **A test function `TestPlusOneFunc`**: This function is used to test the `plusOne` function.

Let's break down the components:

### 1. **The `plusOne` Function**:
```go
func plusOne(digits []int) []int {
    digits[len(digits)-1] = digits[len(digits)-1] + 1
    res := []int{}
    ten := 0.0
    i := len(digits) - 1
    for i >= 0 || ten == 1 {
        sum := 0
        if i >= 0 {
            sum += digits[i]
        }
        if ten != 0 {
            sum += 1
        }
        res = append(res, sum%10)
        ten = float64(sum) / 10.0
        i -= 1
    }

    return utils.ReverseInts(res)
}
```
#### **Explanation**:

1. **Initial Increment**:
   ```go
   digits[len(digits)-1] = digits[len(digits)-1] + 1
   ```
   - This line increments the last digit of the array by 1. It is the starting point for the increment. If this causes a carry-over (i.e., if the last digit becomes 10), the `plusOne` function will handle that in the loop.

2. **Variables**:
   ```go
   res := []int{}
   ten := 0.0
   i := len(digits) - 1
   ```
   - **`res`**: An empty slice that will store the result, which will be the final array of digits after the addition.
   - **`ten`**: A flag (0 or 1) that determines whether there is a carry-over from the previous digit. If `ten` is `1`, it means that the previous sum was 10 or greater, and we need to add a carry to the next digit.
   - **`i`**: An index variable initialized to the last index of the `digits` array. It will be used to traverse the digits array backwards.

3. **Main Loop**:
   ```go
   for i >= 0 || ten == 1 {
       sum := 0
       if i >= 0 {
           sum += digits[i]
       }
       if ten != 0 {
           sum += 1
       }
       res = append(res, sum%10)
       ten = float64(sum) / 10.0
       i -= 1
   }
   ```
   - **`for i >= 0 || ten == 1`**: This loop continues as long as there are digits to process (`i >= 0`) or there is a carry-over (`ten == 1`).
   - Inside the loop:
     - **`sum`** is initialized to 0 at the start of each iteration.
     - If `i >= 0`, it means there is still a digit to process, so the corresponding digit from `digits[i]` is added to `sum`.
     - If `ten != 0`, it means there's a carry-over, so `1` is added to `sum`.
     - The result of the addition is then reduced to a single digit by using the modulo operation (`sum % 10`), and this digit is added to the `res` slice.
     - **`ten`** is updated to be `float64(sum) / 10.0`. If `sum` is 10 or greater, `ten` will be 1, indicating a carry-over to the next digit.
     - **`i -= 1`** moves the index backward to the previous digit.

4. **Reversing the Result**:
   ```go
   return utils.ReverseInts(res)
   ```
   - After processing all the digits and adding the carry-over (if any), the `res` slice contains the digits of the number in reverse order. This is because the loop starts from the least significant digit (rightmost digit). So, the function calls `utils.ReverseInts(res)` to reverse the slice before returning it.

### 2. **The `TestPlusOneFunc` Test Function**:
```go
func TestPlusOneFunc(t *testing.T) {
    t.Log("Test Plus One algorithm")
    nums := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13}
    fmt.Println("INPUT: ", nums)
    fmt.Println("OUTPUT: ", plusOne(nums))
}
```
#### **Explanation**:
- This is a test function that uses the `t.Log()` method from the `testing` package to log messages. It tests the `plusOne` function with a sample input.
- **`nums := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13}`**: This is an array of integers representing a number. In this case, the number is `12345`.
- **`plusOne(nums)`**: The function is tested by passing the `nums` array, and the result is printed.
- The `plusOne` function should increment the number represented by the `nums` array and print the result.

### Example:

Let's walk through an example where the input is `nums := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`:
- **Initial `digits`**: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`
- **After incrementing the last digit**: `1, 2, 3, 4, 6`
- The result after adding the carry (if any) is:
  ```
  1, 2, 3, 4, 6 (no carry-over)
  ```

### Key Concepts:
- **Array of Digits**: The number is represented as an array, where each element is a single digit. This is similar to how large numbers might be represented in an array to avoid overflow in standard data types.
- **Carry-Over**: The algorithm accounts for cases where adding 1 results in a carry-over (e.g., `9 + 1 = 10`), and it propagates the carry to the next higher digit.
- **Reversal**: Since we process the digits from least significant to most significant (right to left), the result array needs to be reversed before returning the final result.

### Summary:
This Go program implements a "plus one" algorithm for incrementing a number represented as an array of digits. It handles carry-over, reverses the digits, and outputs the updated number. The test function is used to check the correctness of the algorithm by printing the input and output.
