This Go program demonstrates **array comparison rules** and highlights **when arrays can or cannot be compared**. Let's break it down.

---

## **1. Arrays Must Have the Same Type to Be Comparable**
```go
var (
    blue = [3]int{6, 9, 3}
    red  = [3]int{6, 9, 3}
)
```
- `blue` and `red` are both **[3]int** (same length and element type).
- Since their **types and elements are identical**, they can be compared.
- **Comparison works**: `blue == red` returns `true`.

### **Key Rule**
‚úÖ Arrays are comparable if **both their type and elements match**.

---

## **2. Arrays Can Have Different Declarations but Still Be Equal**
```go
blue1 = [...]int{6, 9, 3}
red1  = [3]int{6, 9, 3}
```
- `blue1` uses `[...]int{}` (letting Go infer the length as `3`).
- `red1` explicitly declares `[3]int`.
- Since **Go infers `[3]int` for `blue1`**, they have the same type and value.
- **Comparison works**: `blue1 == red1` returns `true`.

### **Key Rule**
‚úÖ **Go allows `[...]int{}` shorthand, as long as the inferred type matches**.

---

## **3. Element Order Matters**
```go
blue2 = [3]int{6, 9, 3}
red2  = [3]int{3, 9, 6}
```
- `blue2` and `red2` **have the same type** (`[3]int`).
- However, their elements are in **different order**.
- **Comparison fails**: `blue2 == red2` returns `false`.

### **Key Rule**
‚ùå **Arrays are only equal if their corresponding elements match exactly (same order and values).**

---

## **4. Missing Elements Affect Comparisons**
```go
blue3 = [3]int{6, 9} // {6, 9, 0} (last element defaults to 0)
red3  = [3]int{6, 9, 3}
```
- `blue3` initializes **only two elements**, so Go fills the last one with `0`.
- `red3` explicitly sets the last element to `3`.
- **Comparison fails**: `blue3 == red3` returns `false`.

### **Key Rule**
‚ùå **If an array is partially initialized, missing elements default to zero. This affects comparisons.**

---

## **5. Arrays of Different Sizes Cannot Be Compared**
```go
// blue4 = [3]int{6, 9, 3}
// red4  = [5]int{6, 9, 3}
```
- `blue4` is `[3]int`, while `red4` is `[5]int`.
- **They have different types** (`[3]int` vs. `[5]int`).
- **Compilation error**: Arrays of different sizes **cannot** be compared.

### **Key Rule**
‚ùå **Arrays must have the exact same length to be comparable. Different lengths = compilation error.**

---

## **6. Arrays with Different Element Types Cannot Be Compared**
```go
// blue5 = [3]int64{6, 9, 3}
// red5  = [3]int{6, 9, 3}
```
- `blue5` is **[3]int64**, while `red5` is **[3]int**.
- Even though they have the same length and values, **their element types (`int64` vs. `int`) are different**.
- **Compilation error**: `blue5 == red5` is invalid.

### **Key Rule**
‚ùå **Arrays with different element types are incompatible and cannot be compared.**

---

## **Key Takeaways: Array Comparison Rules**
| **Comparison Rule** | **Example** | **Valid?** | **Explanation** |
|---------------------|------------|-----------|---------------|
| **Same type & elements** | `[3]int{6, 9, 3} == [3]int{6, 9, 3}` | ‚úÖ | Arrays match exactly. |
| **Shorthand declaration** | `[...int]{6,9,3} == [3]int{6,9,3}` | ‚úÖ | Go infers `[3]int`, making them comparable. |
| **Different order** | `[3]int{6,9,3} == [3]int{3,9,6}` | ‚ùå | Element order matters. |
| **Partially initialized** | `[3]int{6,9} == [3]int{6,9,3}` | ‚ùå | Missing elements default to `0`, making them different. |
| **Different sizes** | `[3]int{6,9,3} == [5]int{6,9,3}` | ‚ùå | Arrays must have **identical length**. |
| **Different element types** | `[3]int64{6,9,3} == [3]int{6,9,3}` | ‚ùå | Arrays must have **identical element types**. |
