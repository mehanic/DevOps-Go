### Algorithm Explanation

This Go program demonstrates working with arrays, performing basic manipulations and calculations.

1. **Array Initialization**: 
   - An array `names` with 3 string elements is created and initialized. Values are assigned to some elements.
   
2. **Manipulating Arrays**: 
   - The program assigns names to the `names` array and prints it after each assignment.
   - Another array `names2` is initialized with multiple strings.
   
3. **Iterating Through Arrays**: 
   - A `for` loop is used to print the elements of `names2`.

4. **Calculating Average**: 
   - An array `marks` holds 5 float values. A `for` loop calculates the sum of these marks, and the average is computed and rounded using `math.Round`.

### Expected Output:

- Prints the names array in different stages of modification.
- Iterates through `names2` and prints each element.
- Calculates and prints the rounded average of the marks array.
