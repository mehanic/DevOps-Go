### **Explanation of Array Indexing and Initialization in Go**

This Go program demonstrates the **initialization of arrays** using **explicit index assignment**. The key concept here is assigning values to specific indices while leaving other indices uninitialized (or set to zero). This behavior is unique to arrays in Go.

### **Key Concepts in the Code**

#### **1. Array Initialization with Explicit Index**
```go
rates := [3]float64{
    2: 1.5, // index: 2
}
```
- **Array Type**: `[3]float64` indicates an array with a fixed size of 3 and type `float64`.
- The array is initialized with **only one element** explicitly set: `rates[2] = 1.5`.
- **Uninitialized Indices**: The other indices (0 and 1) are **automatically assigned a zero value** (which for `float64` is `0`).
- **Output**: 
  ```
  [0 0 1.5]
  ```

#### **2. Ellipsis (`...`) for Array Size Inference**
```go
rates := [...]float64{
    5: 1.5, // index: 5
}
```
- **Ellipsis (`...`)**: When creating the array, Go uses the **ellipsis (`...`)** to **infer the array size** based on the number of initialized elements.
- **Index Assignment**: The value `1.5` is explicitly assigned to `rates[5]`, and all other indices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) are automatically initialized to zero.
- **Output**: 
  ```
  [0 0 0 0 0 1.5]
  ```

#### **3. Mixed Initialization**
```go
rates := [...]float64{
    5:   1.5, // index: 5
    2.5, //      index: 6
    0:   0.5, // index: 0
}
```
- **Mixed Initialization**: This shows a more complex case where you can **assign values to arbitrary indices**, and Go fills in the uninitialized indices with the **zero value** (`0`).
- **Resulting Array**: 
  - `rates[0]` is set to `0.5`
  - `rates[5]` is set to `1.5`
  - `rates[6]` is set to `2.5`
  - All other indices (1, 2, 3, 4) are set to `0`.
- **Output**:
  ```
  [0.5 0 0 0 0 1.5 2.5]
  ```

### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Array Size Determination**: 
   - When using **explicit index assignments**, the array size is **determined based on the highest index** you provide, plus 1. If you specify an index `5`, the array has 6 elements (indices `0` through `5`).

2. **Zero Value for Uninitialized Indices**: 
   - All **uninitialized indices** are automatically given their **zero values** (for `float64`, it's `0.0`).
   
3. **Ellipsis (`...`)**: 
   - Using the ellipsis (`...`) allows you to let Go **determine the size** of the array based on the number of values you provide.

4. **Flexibility in Initialization**: 
   - You can initialize arrays with specific values at any index, and Go will automatically handle the rest, filling the remaining indices with their zero values.

### **Output Breakdown**
Hereâ€™s how each `fmt.Println(rates)` statement works:

- **First `fmt.Println(rates)`**:
  ```go
  [0 0 1.5]
  ```
  The array has 3 elements with index `2` set to `1.5`, and the rest are `0`.

- **Second `fmt.Println(rates)`**:
  ```go
  [0 0 0 0 0 1.5]
  ```
  The array has 6 elements, with index `5` set to `1.5`, and the rest are `0`.

- **Third `fmt.Println(rates)`**:
  ```go
  [0.5 0 0 0 0 1.5 2.5]
  ```
  The array has 7 elements, with specific indices assigned values, and the uninitialized ones are `0`.
