### Algorithm Explanation for README.md

This program demonstrates basic operations with arrays in Go. 

1. **Array Initialization**: A fixed-size array `arr` of integers is declared with 5 elements, all initially set to 0.
2. **Assigning Values**: Values are manually assigned to each index of the array.
3. **Accessing Elements**: The program prints the values at specific indices (`arr[0]` and `arr[1]`).
4. **Array Calculation**: The program sums `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`, then prints the result.
5. **New Array**: A new array `newarr` of strings is initialized with three string values, and printed.
