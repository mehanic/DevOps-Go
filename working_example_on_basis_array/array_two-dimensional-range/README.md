Let's break down and explain the code and its structure, step by step.

### **Code Overview:**
The main goal of this Go program is to compute the average of grades for a group of students. It does this in three different ways, as represented by three blocks of code labeled `#1 - THE BEST WAY`, `#2 - SO SO WAY`, and `#3 - MANUAL WAY`.

### **#1 - THE BEST WAY:**

```go
students := [...][3]float64{
	{5, 6, 1},
	{9, 8, 4},
}
```

**Explanation:**
- This defines a 2D array named `students` using Go's array syntax. Specifically, it's a 2x3 array where:
  - The first row represents the grades of the first student: `{5, 6, 1}`
  - The second row represents the grades of the second student: `{9, 8, 4}`
- The use of `...` before the `[...]` notation tells Go to automatically infer the size of the outer array based on the number of elements. In this case, the size of `students` will be `2`, since there are two sets of grades.

```go
var sum float64
for _, grades := range students {
	for _, grade := range grades {
		sum += grade
	}
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `sum` is declared to accumulate the total sum of all grades.
- The outer `for` loop iterates over each student's grades, and the inner `for` loop iterates over each grade in a student's grade list.
- `sum += grade` adds each grade to the `sum` for all students.

```go
const N = float64(len(students) * len(students[0]))
fmt.Printf("Avg Grade: %g\n", sum/N)
```

**Explanation:**
- `N` is the total number of grades (the number of students multiplied by the number of grades per student). In this case, `len(students)` is `2` (the number of students), and `len(students[0])` is `3` (the number of grades per student), so `N = 2 * 3 = 6`.
- Finally, the average grade is calculated by dividing the total `sum` by `N`. The result is printed using `fmt.Printf`.

**Result:**
This block calculates the average grade of all students. The output is:

```
Avg Grade: 5.5
```

### **#2 - SO SO WAY (Commented Out):**

```go
// students1 := [2][3]float64{
// 	[3]float64{5, 6, 1},
// 	[3]float64{9, 8, 4},
// }
```

**Explanation:**
- This block is commented out and was likely intended as an alternative, but it’s not in use.
- `students1` is another way of defining the same 2x3 array of grades, but it’s a bit more verbose compared to the first block. Here, the inner arrays are explicitly defined with the `[3]float64{}` syntax for each row.

```go
sum += students1[0][0] + students1[0][1] + students1[0][2]
sum += students1[1][0] + students1[1][1] + students1[1][2]
```

**Explanation:**
- In this version, the grades are manually summed up for each individual student by explicitly adding each element in the array (i.e., each grade for each student).

```go
const D = float64(len(students1) * len(students1[0]))
fmt.Printf("Avg Grade: %g\n", sum1/D)
```

**Explanation:**
- `D` is calculated the same way as `N` in the first block, but the sum is manually calculated, which is error-prone and not as flexible as the first block.

### **#3 - MANUAL WAY (Commented Out):**

```go
// student1 := [3]float64{5, 6, 1}
// student2 := [3]float64{9, 8, 4}
```

**Explanation:**
- In this block, each student's grades are stored in separate arrays. This is a less flexible way to represent multiple students since you have to manually define an array for each student.

```go
sum += student1[0] + student1[1] + student1[2]
sum += student2[0] + student2[1] + student2[2]
```

**Explanation:**
- The sum of grades is manually calculated for each student, just as in `#2 - SO SO WAY`.

```go
const N = float64(len(student1) * 2)
fmt.Printf("Avg Grade: %g\n", sum/N)
```

**Explanation:**
- The average is again calculated manually, using the total number of grades (which is `3` grades per student times `2` students).
- This is a hardcoded way of calculating the average and is not as flexible as using the array-based approach in the first block.

### **Summary of the Approaches:**

1. **#1 - THE BEST WAY:** This method uses a flexible 2D array and nested loops to sum all the grades. It automatically works for any number of students and grades. It's the most elegant and scalable solution.
2. **#2 - SO SO WAY:** This method manually sums the grades of each student in a more verbose way. It's still correct but less flexible.
3. **#3 - MANUAL WAY:** This method involves hardcoding arrays for each student and manually summing the grades. It’s the least flexible, as it doesn’t easily scale to more students.

### **Conclusion:**
- **The Best Way** is the most efficient, scalable, and elegant approach for handling arrays of students and calculating the average grades.
- **The So-So Way** and **Manual Way** are more verbose and less flexible.
- By using a 2D array and looping through it, **The Best Way** can handle any number of students and grades without needing to change the code.
