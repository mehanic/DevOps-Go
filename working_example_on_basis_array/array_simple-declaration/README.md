### Explanation of the Code:

In this Go code, we have two main functions, `main` and `main2`, that demonstrate how to work with arrays in Go. Let's go step by step to explain the code and the rules behind it:

### Code Breakdown:

1. **In the `main` function:**
   ```go
   rates := [3]float64{
       0.5,
       2.5,
       1.5,
   }
   fmt.Println(rates)
   ```
   - An array named `rates` is defined with a size of `3` and of type `float64`.
   - The values of the elements in the array are provided in the order they should appear:
     - `rates[0] = 0.5`
     - `rates[1] = 2.5`
     - `rates[2] = 1.5`
   - When `fmt.Println(rates)` is called, it prints the array:
     ```
     [0.5 2.5 1.5]
     ```

2. **Calling the `main2` function:**
   ```go
   main2()
   ```
   - The `main2()` function is called after printing the first array.

3. **Inside the `main2` function:**
   ```go
   rates := [3]float64{
       0: 0.6, // index: 0
       1: 2.6, // index: 1
       2: 1.6, // index: 2
   }
   fmt.Println(rates)
   ```
   - A new array `rates` is defined in `main2` with the same size `3` and type `float64`.
   - Here, we are explicitly specifying the values for each index using the `index: value` syntax:
     - `rates[0] = 0.6`
     - `rates[1] = 2.6`
     - `rates[2] = 1.6`
   - When `fmt.Println(rates)` is called, it prints the array:
     ```
     [0.6 2.6 1.6]
     ```

### Key Concepts and Rules:

1. **Arrays in Go:**
   - In Go, an array is a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type.
   - The size of the array must be specified when declaring it.
   - In this example, both arrays are of type `float64` and size `3`.

2. **Array Initialization (Shorthand and Explicit Indexing):**
   - In the first `main` function, the array is initialized in a shorthand way where the values are listed sequentially:
     ```go
     rates := [3]float64{0.5, 2.5, 1.5}
     ```
     This is a compact way to initialize the array without specifying the indices explicitly.
   - In the second function `main2`, the array is initialized using explicit indexing:
     ```go
     rates := [3]float64{0: 0.6, 1: 2.6, 2: 1.6}
     ```
     This way allows you to explicitly define the value at each index, even though the array size is already defined. It makes it clear which value is being assigned to each index.

3. **Arrays Are Passed by Value in Go:**
   - When an array is passed to a function in Go, it is **passed by value**, meaning a copy of the array is created inside the function.
   - Therefore, modifying the array inside `main2` will not affect the array in `main`. Each function has its own separate copy of the `rates` array.

4. **Output:**
   - The first array printed in the `main` function is `[0.5 2.5 1.5]`, which was initialized in the first function.
   - The second array printed in `main2` is `[0.6 2.6 1.6]`, which was initialized with explicit indexing in `main2`.

### Conclusion:

- **Array Initialization**: You can initialize arrays in two ways:
  1. By listing the values directly (shorthand).
  2. By explicitly specifying the index-value pairs.
  
- **Arrays Are Fixed-Size**: In Go, once you define the size of an array (in this case, `3`), it cannot be resized.
  
- **Passing by Value**: Arrays are passed by value in Go, meaning that modifications to an array inside a function won't affect the original array.

### Output:
- The output of this code will be:
  ```
  [0.5 2.5 1.5]
  [0.6 2.6 1.6]
  ```
This shows how each function has its own array and operates on it separately.
