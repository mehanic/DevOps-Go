## Array Concepts in Go

This program explores various ways to declare, initialize, and manipulate arrays in Go.

### Algorithm Breakdown:

1. **Declaring an Empty Array**  
   - `arr1` is declared with five `int` elements, all initialized to zero.

2. **Declaring and Initializing an Array**  
   - `arr2` and `arr3` contain predefined values.

3. **Initializing Specific Indexes**  
   - `arr4` assigns values only to certain positions.

4. **Inferring Array Length**  
   - `arr5` uses `...` to determine the length automatically.

5. **Multi-dimensional Arrays**  
   - `multiArray` and `initializedMultiArray` demonstrate 2D arrays.

6. **Pointer Arrays**  
   - `pointerArray` stores addresses of integer variables.

7. **Arrays of Structs**  
   - `structArray` holds multiple `Person` structs.

This program demonstrates fundamental array operations in Go, including initialization, multi-dimensional structures, pointers, and struct arrays.
