## **Algorithm Explanation**

This Go program identifies and prints the even numbers from an array:

1. **checkForEven Function:**
   - This function checks if a given number `k` is even. It returns `true` if `k` is divisible by 2, otherwise `false`.

2. **Main Program:**
   - An array `arr` is initialized with integers from 1 to 9.
   - The program loops through each element of the array, using the `checkForEven` function to check if the element is even.
   - If an element is even, it gets printed.

### **Example Output**
```
2
4
6
8
```

### **Key Points**
- The program demonstrates how to use loops and conditional checks in Go to filter even numbers from an array.
