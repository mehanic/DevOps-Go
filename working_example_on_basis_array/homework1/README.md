Let's break down the Go program and explain each part step by step.

### **1️⃣ Initializing Variables**

```go
arr := [10]int{10, 20, 30, 1, -10, 1, 2, 3}
max := 0
ottepel := 0
n := len(arr)
```

- **`arr := [10]int{10, 20, 30, 1, -10, 1, 2, 3}`**:
  - This initializes an array of **10 integers**.
  - The elements in the array are: `[10, 20, 30, 1, -10, 1, 2, 3]`.

- **`max := 0`**:
  - This initializes the variable `max`, which will hold the length of the longest subsequence of **non-negative numbers** (this represents the longest "warm spell" or **"ottepel"**).

- **`ottepel := 0`**:
  - This initializes the variable `ottepel`, which will keep track of the current length of the **non-negative subsequence** as we iterate through the array.

- **`n := len(arr)`**:
  - This calculates the length of the array `arr`, which is `10`, and stores it in the variable `n`.

### **2️⃣ Looping Through the Array**
```go
for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
    if arr[i] >= 0 {
        ottepel += 1
    } else {
        if ottepel > max {
            max = ottepel
        }
        ottepel = 0
    }
}
```

- **`for i := 0; i < n; i++`**:
  - This starts a `for` loop that iterates over each element of the array `arr` from index `0` to `n-1` (i.e., through all 10 elements of the array).

#### **Inside the Loop**
- **`if arr[i] >= 0 {`**:
  - If the current element `arr[i]` is **non-negative** (i.e., greater than or equal to `0`), the `ottepel` variable is incremented (`ottepel += 1`).
  - This means we are counting the length of the current subsequence of consecutive non-negative numbers.

- **`else {`**:
  - If the current element is **negative** (i.e., less than `0`), it means the streak of non-negative numbers is interrupted.
  - In this case, we check if the length of the previous subsequence of non-negative numbers (`ottepel`) is greater than the current maximum subsequence length (`max`):
    - If **`ottepel > max`**, we update `max` to the value of `ottepel`, since we have found a longer subsequence of non-negative numbers.
  - After handling the negative element, we **reset the `ottepel`** to `0` because the subsequence of non-negative numbers has ended.

### **3️⃣ Print the Result**
```go
fmt.Println("Продолжительная оттепель = ", max)
```
- This prints the result: the length of the longest subsequence of **non-negative numbers** in the array `arr`, which is stored in `max`.

### **Explanation of the Example**

Given the array:
```go
arr := [10]int{10, 20, 30, 1, -10, 1, 2, 3}
```

- We iterate through each element in the array:
  - **First 4 elements** (`10, 20, 30, 1`) are all non-negative, so `ottepel` becomes `4`.
  - **Next element** (`-10`) is negative, so we check if `ottepel` (`4`) is greater than `max` (which was initially `0`), and we update `max` to `4`.
  - **Next 3 elements** (`1, 2, 3`) are non-negative, so `ottepel` becomes `3`, but `max` remains `4` because `ottepel` is no longer greater than `max`.
  
- Finally, the **longest subsequence of non-negative numbers** was `4` (`10, 20, 30, 1`), and it is printed as:
  ```
  Продолжительная оттепель =  4
  ```

### **Summary**
- The program calculates the length of the **longest subsequence** of **non-negative numbers** (i.e., "warm spells" or "оттепель").
- As the program iterates over the array, it counts consecutive non-negative numbers, and whenever it encounters a negative number, it checks if the current subsequence is the longest and updates the maximum length if necessary.
