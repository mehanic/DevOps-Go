The algorithm you provided modifies the elements of an array of book titles in two different ways using Go's string manipulation functions. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Array Initialization**: You have an array `books` containing three book titles.
2. **Uppercase Transformation**: `upper` is a copy of `books`, and each book title is converted to uppercase using `strings.ToUpper()`.
3. **Lowercase Transformation**: `lower` is another copy of `books`, and each title is converted to lowercase using `strings.ToLower()`.
4. **Output**: The program prints the original `books` array, and the transformed `upper` and `lower` arrays.

In summary, the algorithm processes the same array (`books`) into two new arrays (`upper` and `lower`) with transformed string cases, and prints all three arrays.
