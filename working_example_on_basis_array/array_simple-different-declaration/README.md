This Go code provides a good introduction to arrays, loops, and basic function handling. Let's break down the concepts and rules it covers in detail:

### 1. **Declaring and Using Arrays**
```go
cityOne := "istanbul"
cityTwo := "roma"
cityThree := "tahran"
cityFour := "belgrad"
fmt.Println(cityOne, cityTwo, cityThree, cityFour)
```
- Here, **variables** for storing individual city names are declared and initialized with string values. These variables represent **primitive data types** (strings in this case).
  
- **Arrays** are used next. An array in Go is a fixed-size collection of elements of the same type:
  ```go
  town := [4]string{"Tokio", "Seul", "Sapporo", "Kioto"}
  fmt.Println(town)
  ```
  - `town` is an array of 4 strings (each representing a city).
  - Arrays in Go are **fixed-length** and the length is part of the array's type, i.e., `town` is of type `[4]string` (a fixed array of 4 strings).

### 2. **Commented-Out Code: Slices and Length**
The commented-out lines indicate an attempt to use **slices** and operations on them:
```go
// cities3 := []string{"istanbul", "roma", "tahran", "belgrad"}
// fmt.Println(cities3)
// fmt.Println(cities3[0]) // zero based index
// fmt.Println(cities3[3])
// fmt.Println(len(cities3))
// cities3[3] = "Ankara"
// fmt.Println(cities3[4]) // static length variable issue
```
- **Slices** are similar to arrays but **dynamically sized** and do not require a fixed length at the time of declaration.
- When manipulating slices, you can access their elements using **zero-based indexing** and get the length with `len(slice)`.
- The error (`cities3[4]`) occurs because the slice has a length of 4, and accessing an index outside that range results in a runtime error.

### 3. **Array Length and Indexing**
```go
cities1 := [4]string{"istanbul", "roma", "tahran", "belgrad"}
for i := 0; i < len(cities1); i++ {
    fmt.Println(i, cities1[i])
}
```
- This loop iterates over the `cities1` array, using **zero-based indexing** to access each city and print its index (`i`) and value (`cities1[i]`).

- The array's **length** is obtained using `len()`, which gives the number of elements in the array.

- **Arrays are fixed size** in Go, and the length of an array cannot be changed after itâ€™s declared. The length is defined at the time of initialization (`[4]string`).

### 4. **Changing Array Values**
```go
cities1[0] = "ANKARA"
```
- You can modify the value of an array element by specifying the index, like in `cities1[0] = "ANKARA"`.

### 5. **Using `for ... range` Loop (Simplified Iteration)**
```go
for _, city := range cities {
    fmt.Println(city)
}
```
- **`for ... range`** is a more idiomatic way to loop over arrays, slices, or maps in Go.
- The loop provides both the **index** and the **value** for each element. However, by using the blank identifier (`_`), the **index** is ignored in this case. This is useful if you only care about the value and not the index.
  
  In this example, it prints all the city names from the `cities` array, ignoring the index.

### 6. **Function with Arrays (Passing by Value)**
```go
myArr := [10]int{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
myArr = mySquare(myArr) // First Class Functions
fmt.Println(myArr)
```
- The function `mySquare` takes an array of size `10` and returns a new array where each element is squared.
  
```go
func mySquare(arr [10]int) [10]int {
    for i := 0; i < len(arr); i++ {
        arr[i] = arr[i] * arr[i]
    }
    return arr
}
```
- The `mySquare` function accepts an array of size `10` (`[10]int`) as an argument and returns a modified array of the same size.
- **Arrays are passed by value** in Go, meaning the function works with a **copy** of the array. If you modify the array inside the function, it doesn't affect the original array. However, the modified array is returned and reassigned back to `myArr`.
- **First-class functions** in Go allow functions to be passed around as arguments, assigned to variables, or returned from other functions, just like any other value.

### Key Points:
1. **Arrays in Go are fixed-size** and cannot grow or shrink dynamically.
2. **Slices** are more flexible than arrays because they can change size.
3. Arrays and slices are **zero-indexed**.
4. Arrays are **passed by value** in Go, meaning any changes to an array in a function do not affect the original array unless you explicitly return the modified array.
5. The **`for ... range` loop** allows for easy iteration over arrays, slices, or maps in Go, and you can discard the index if not needed using `_`.
6. **Functions can return arrays** in Go, and arrays passed to a function are copied (passed by value).

### Output:
The output of the program will be:
```
istanbul roma tahran belgrad
[Tokio Seul Sapporo Kioto]
----------------------------------
0 istanbul
1 roma
2 tahran
3 belgrad

0 ANKARA
1 roma
2 tahran
3 belgrad
----------------------------------
istanbul
roma
tahran
belgrad
----------------------------------
[0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81]
```

This demonstrates array initialization, loops, and the manipulation of arrays and slices in Go.
