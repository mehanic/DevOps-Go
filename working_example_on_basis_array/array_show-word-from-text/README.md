### Explanation of the Code:

This Go program allows a user to search for words in a predefined corpus of text and outputs the positions (indices) of those words in the corpus. The program also filters out certain common words (such as "and", "the", etc.) from the search.

Let's break down the code and its rules step by step:

### Code Breakdown:

1. **Defining the `corpus`:**
   ```go
   const corpus = "lazy cat jumps again and again and again since the beginning this was very important"
   ```
   - The `corpus` constant holds a predefined string of text. This is the text in which the user will search for specific words.

2. **Reading User Input:**
   ```go
   query := os.Args[1:]
   if len(query) == 0 {
       fmt.Println("Please give me a word to search.")
       return
   }
   ```
   - `os.Args[1:]` captures the arguments passed to the program via the command line. The program expects the user to provide one or more words to search for in the corpus.
   - If no search word is provided, the program prints a message and exits.

3. **Defining the `filter` Array:**
   ```go
   filter := [...]string{
       "and", "or", "was", "the", "since", "very",
   }
   ```
   - The `filter` array contains a list of words that will **not** be searched. These are common words like "and", "or", "was", etc., which the program considers irrelevant for the search. Words in the `filter` array are ignored during the search.

4. **Splitting the `corpus` into Words:**
   ```go
   words := strings.Fields(corpus)
   ```
   - `strings.Fields(corpus)` splits the `corpus` string into individual words based on whitespace. The result is stored in the `words` slice. This slice contains the individual words in the corpus like `["lazy", "cat", "jumps", "again", "and", "again", "and", "again", ...]`.

5. **Processing the User's Query:**
   ```go
   queries:
   for _, q := range query {
       q = strings.ToLower(q)
   ```
   - The program iterates over each word in the user's query (`query`). The word is converted to lowercase using `strings.ToLower(q)` to make the search case-insensitive.

6. **Checking Against the `filter` List:**
   ```go
   for _, v := range filter {
       if q == v {
           continue queries
       }
   ```
   - If the query word matches any word in the `filter` list (such as "and", "or", etc.), the program **skips** the rest of the processing for that query word by using `continue queries`. This ensures that words in the `filter` list are ignored in the search.

7. **Searching for the Word in the Corpus:**
   ```go
   for i, w := range words {
       if q == w {
           fmt.Printf("#%-2d: %q\n", i+1, w)
           break
       }
   }
   ```
   - If the query word is not in the `filter` list, the program searches for the word in the `words` slice (the split-up `corpus`).
   - The program loops through each word in `words` and compares it with the current query word (`q`). If it finds a match, it prints the word's index (1-based, i.e., `i+1`) and the word itself.
   - Once a match is found, it breaks out of the inner loop and moves on to the next query.

8. **Output Format:**
   ```go
   fmt.Printf("#%-2d: %q\n", i+1, w)
   ```
   - This prints the index of the found word in the `corpus` and the word itself, using a 1-based index (`i+1`) and the word in quotes (`%q`).

### Example Output:

If the program is run with the following command:
```bash
go run main.go "again"
```

The output will be:
```
#4 : "again"
```

- The word "again" first appears at index 4 in the corpus (considering 1-based indexing), so it prints `#4 : "again"`.

### Key Rules and Concepts:

1. **Command-Line Arguments (`os.Args`)**:
   - The program takes user input from the command line. The user must provide words to search for after the program name.

2. **Filtering Specific Words**:
   - Words in the `filter` list are ignored during the search. This helps to avoid searching for common words (like "and", "or", "was", etc.) that are usually irrelevant in certain searches (such as search engines or text processing).

3. **Search Process**:
   - The program splits the corpus into words and then searches for each query word in the corpus. The search is case-insensitive.
   - If the word is found, its position (1-based index) and the word itself are printed.

4. **Skipping Words in the Filter List**:
   - If a query word is in the `filter` list, it is skipped using `continue`, and no search is done for it.

### Potential Improvements:
- **Multiple Matches**: The program only prints the first occurrence of each query word in the corpus. If you wanted to find all occurrences of a word, you could modify the program to print every match.
- **Better User Interaction**: The program could be extended to handle errors more gracefully (e.g., handling missing or invalid input better).
- **Efficiency**: Instead of using a nested loop (`for _, v := range filter` and `for _, w := range words`), you could use a map for the filter to improve lookup time, especially if the corpus grows larger.
