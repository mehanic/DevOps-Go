Let's break down the Go code you provided and explain how it works, including how command-line arguments are handled.

### Code Breakdown:
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	count := len(os.Args) - 1
	fmt.Printf("There are %d names.\n", count)
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Package Declaration**:
   ```go
   package main
   ```
   - This is the entry point of your Go program. The `main` package is required for any executable program, and it signifies that this program will run independently (not as a library).

2. **Imports**:
   ```go
   import (
		"fmt"
		"os"
   )
   ```
   - `fmt`: This package is used for formatted I/O (like printing text to the terminal).
   - `os`: This package provides functions to interact with the operating system, and in this case, we use it to access command-line arguments passed to the program.

3. **The `main` function**:
   ```go
   func main() {
		count := len(os.Args) - 1
		fmt.Printf("There are %d names.\n", count)
   }
   ```
   - `func main()`: This is the entry point of the program. When the program is run, execution starts from here.
   - `os.Args`: This is a slice (array-like structure) containing the command-line arguments passed to the program. It includes the name of the program as the first argument (`os.Args[0]`), followed by any additional arguments provided by the user when running the program.

   **How `os.Args` works**:
   - `os.Args[0]`: This is always the name of the program, i.e., the name of the Go executable or the file that was run.
   - `os.Args[1], os.Args[2], ...`: These are the additional arguments passed by the user on the command line when running the program.
   
   So, if the program is run with the following command:
   ```bash
   go run main.go Alice Bob Charlie
   ```
   - `os.Args[0]` will be `"main.go"`, which is the name of the program.
   - `os.Args[1]` will be `"Alice"`, `os.Args[2]` will be `"Bob"`, and `os.Args[3]` will be `"Charlie"`.

   **`len(os.Args)`**: This returns the **total number of elements** in the `os.Args` slice, which includes the program name itself.
   - In the case of running the program like `go run main.go Alice Bob Charlie`, `len(os.Args)` will return `4` because there are 4 elements in the slice (`"main.go"`, `"Alice"`, `"Bob"`, `"Charlie"`).
   - `len(os.Args) - 1`: Subtracting 1 gives the number of **additional arguments** passed (excluding the program name). In this case, `len(os.Args) - 1` will give `3`, because three names (`Alice`, `Bob`, `Charlie`) were passed.

4. **Formatted Output**:
   ```go
   fmt.Printf("There are %d names.\n", count)
   ```
   - This prints a formatted string to the console. The `%d` is a placeholder for an integer value, which is replaced by the `count` variable, which holds the number of command-line arguments (in this case, the number of names passed).
   - The output will be: `"There are 3 names."` when running `go run main.go Alice Bob Charlie`.

### Example Run:
If you run the program like this:
```bash
go run main.go Alice Bob Charlie
```

1. `os.Args` will be:
   - `os.Args[0] = "main.go"`
   - `os.Args[1] = "Alice"`
   - `os.Args[2] = "Bob"`
   - `os.Args[3] = "Charlie"`

2. `len(os.Args)` will return `4` (because it counts the program name `"main.go"` as well).

3. Subtracting `1` (`len(os.Args) - 1`) results in `3`.

4. The output printed to the terminal will be:
   ```
   There are 3 names.
   ```

### Conclusion:
- **`os.Args`** is a built-in Go feature that lets you access command-line arguments passed to your program.
- The program calculates how many additional arguments (names, in this case) were passed by subtracting 1 from the length of `os.Args` (since `os.Args[0]` is the program name).
- The program prints out the count of names passed as arguments.

This kind of functionality is commonly used for handling inputs or configurations provided at the time of execution.
