This Go program is designed to take user inputs with validation for two things: **age** and **password**. Here's how it works:

### **Explanation of the Code:**

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"regexp"
	"strings"
)

func main() {
	reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)

	// Validate age input
	for {
		fmt.Println("Enter your age:")
		ageInput, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
		ageInput = strings.TrimSpace(ageInput)

		// Check if the input is a valid decimal number
		if _, err := fmt.Sscanf(ageInput, "%d", new(int)); err == nil {
			break
		} else {
			fmt.Println("Please enter a number for your age.")
		}
	}

	// Validate password input (letters and numbers only)
	for {
		fmt.Println("Select a new password (letters and numbers only):")
		passwordInput, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
		passwordInput = strings.TrimSpace(passwordInput)

		// Regular expression to check if the password is alphanumeric
		if matched, _ := regexp.MatchString(`^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$`, passwordInput); matched {
			break
		} else {
			fmt.Println("Passwords can only have letters and numbers.")
		}
	}
}
```

### **Code Breakdown:**

#### **Step 1: Age Validation**
- **Reader Initialization:** 
  ```go
  reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)
  ```
  - `bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)` is used to read input from the user. It reads until a newline character (`\n`).
  
- **For Loop for Age Input Validation:**
  ```go
  for {
      fmt.Println("Enter your age:")
      ageInput, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
      ageInput = strings.TrimSpace(ageInput)
  ```
  - The program continuously prompts the user to enter their age.
  - `reader.ReadString('\n')` reads the input as a string, including the newline character. `strings.TrimSpace(ageInput)` removes any leading or trailing spaces or newline characters.

- **Age Validation with `fmt.Sscanf`:**
  ```go
  if _, err := fmt.Sscanf(ageInput, "%d", new(int)); err == nil {
      break
  } else {
      fmt.Println("Please enter a number for your age.")
  }
  ```
  - `fmt.Sscanf(ageInput, "%d", new(int))` tries to parse the input as an integer (`%d`).
  - If the input is a valid integer, it breaks the loop (`err == nil`).
  - If the input is not a valid number, it prints "Please enter a number for your age" and asks the user to try again.

#### **Step 2: Password Validation**
- **For Loop for Password Input Validation:**
  ```go
  for {
      fmt.Println("Select a new password (letters and numbers only):")
      passwordInput, _ := reader.ReadString('\n')
      passwordInput = strings.TrimSpace(passwordInput)
  ```
  - Similar to the age validation, the program continuously asks for the user's password input.
  - `strings.TrimSpace(passwordInput)` is used to remove any spaces or newline characters around the input.

- **Password Validation with Regular Expression:**
  ```go
  if matched, _ := regexp.MatchString(`^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$`, passwordInput); matched {
      break
  } else {
      fmt.Println("Passwords can only have letters and numbers.")
  }
  ```
  - The regular expression `^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$` is used to check if the password contains only **letters** (both uppercase and lowercase) and **numbers**.
    - `^` indicates the start of the string.
    - `[a-zA-Z0-9]` specifies that the string can contain any combination of letters (both lowercase `a-z` and uppercase `A-Z`) and numbers (`0-9`).
    - `+` ensures that the password has at least one valid character.
    - `$` indicates the end of the string.
  - If the password matches the regular expression, the loop is exited (`break`), and the password is considered valid.
  - If it doesn't match, the program prompts the user again with the message "Passwords can only have letters and numbers."

### **Program Flow:**

1. The program first prompts the user to enter their **age**. It continues to ask for the age until a valid integer is entered.
   - Example input: `30` → The program will move forward if it's a valid integer.

2. Next, it prompts the user to enter a **password**. The password must contain only letters and numbers (no special characters, spaces, or other symbols).
   - Example input: `34rt` → The password is valid and the loop will break.

3. If the user enters invalid inputs, the program keeps asking the user to enter the correct values.

### **Example Run:**

```
Enter your age:
30
Select a new password (letters and numbers only):
34rt
```

- In this case, the age input `30` is valid, and the password `34rt` is also valid because it only contains letters and numbers.

### **Key Concepts in the Code:**

1. **String Input Handling:**
   - `bufio.NewReader` is used to read input, and `strings.TrimSpace` ensures any unwanted newline or spaces are removed from the input.
   
2. **Validating Integer Input:**
   - `fmt.Sscanf` is used to check if the input can be converted into an integer.

3. **Regular Expressions (Regex):**
   - `regexp.MatchString` is used to match the password input against a regular expression that enforces alphanumeric characters.

4. **Loops for Input Validation:**
   - The `for` loop ensures the user keeps trying until they enter a valid value. The program will only continue when the input is valid for both age and password.

This code ensures that the user is prompted repeatedly until valid input is provided, improving the user experience and ensuring data integrity.
