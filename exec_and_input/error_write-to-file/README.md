The provided Go program demonstrates how to use the `log` package to log error messages to a file instead of the console. Let's break it down:

### Code Breakdown:

1. **`init` Function:**
   ```go
   func init() {
       nf, err := os.Create("log.txt")
       if err != nil {
           fmt.Println(err)
       }
       log.SetOutput(nf) // set output destination of package log
   }
   ```
   - **Purpose of `init()` function**: The `init()` function is a special function in Go that gets executed automatically before the `main()` function. It is used here to set up the log file (`log.txt`) for logging.
   
   - **Creating a file**: The `os.Create("log.txt")` statement creates (or truncates if it already exists) the file `log.txt` in the current directory. It returns a file descriptor (`nf`) and an error (`err`).
     - If the file creation fails (for example, due to permission issues or other file system errors), it prints the error to the console using `fmt.Println(err)`.
   
   - **Setting log output**: The `log.SetOutput(nf)` function call directs the output of the `log` package to the file (`log.txt`) instead of the default destination, which is the console.
     - After this, any logs produced by the `log` package will be written to `log.txt`.

2. **Main Function:**
   ```go
   func main() {
       _, err := os.Open("no-file.txt")
       if err != nil {
           log.Println("err happened:", err) // will write message to log.txt
       }
   }
   ```
   - **Attempt to open a file**: The `os.Open("no-file.txt")` statement attempts to open the file `no-file.txt` for reading. Since this file does not exist (or cannot be opened), it returns an error (`err`).
   
   - **Logging the error**: 
     - If the file cannot be opened (`err != nil`), the error is logged using the `log.Println()` function.
     - The message `"err happened:"` along with the error description is written to the log file (`log.txt`). 
     - Because the `log.SetOutput(nf)` in the `init()` function has already redirected log output to `log.txt`, the error message will be written to that file, not to the console.

### How It Works:

1. When the program runs, it first executes the `init()` function to set up logging to `log.txt`.
2. It then tries to open `no-file.txt`, which doesn't exist, so it triggers an error.
3. The error is logged using the `log.Println()` function, and the message is written to the `log.txt` file.

### Output:

- If the file `no-file.txt` does not exist, the error will be logged into the `log.txt` file. The contents of `log.txt` will look like:
  
  ```
  err happened: open no-file.txt: no such file or directory
  ```

- If the file `no-file.txt` does exist, the program will try to open it, and no error will occur, so no log will be written.

### Key Points:
- **Logging to a file**: By using `log.SetOutput(nf)`, we can configure the `log` package to write its log messages to a file instead of the default destination (stdout).
  
- **`init()` function**: The `init()` function is automatically called before the `main()` function, making it ideal for setup tasks like initializing log files or other configurations.

- **Error handling and logging**: Whenever an error occurs, you can log it using `log.Println()`, and in this case, it is written to `log.txt`. This is helpful for debugging and monitoring applications.

### Summary:
This program demonstrates how to create a log file and use the `log` package to write error messages to that file. The `init()` function sets up the logging configuration, and the `main()` function generates an error (attempting to open a non-existent file) and logs the error to the log file (`log.txt`). This is a useful pattern for managing error logs in applications.
