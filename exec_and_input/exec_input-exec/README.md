This Go code demonstrates how to execute a system command (in this case, `ls -l`) and capture its output. Let's break it down step by step:

### 1. **Imports:**
```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"os/exec"
)
```
- **`fmt`**: The standard Go package for formatted input and output. It's used here to print the output of the system command to the console.
- **`log`**: A package for logging errors or information. It is used here to log any errors if the system command execution fails.
- **`os/exec`**: The package that allows you to run external commands from within a Go program. In this case, it's used to run the `ls` command.

### 2. **CaptureOutput Function:**
```go
func CaptureOutput() {
	out, err := exec.Command("ls", "-l").Output() //  просто сразу возвращаем вывод команды
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	fmt.Println(string(out))
}
```
- **`exec.Command("ls", "-l")`**: 
  - This creates an `exec.Cmd` object that represents the `ls` command with the `-l` option (which lists files in long format).
  - The `exec.Command` function is used to build the command that will be executed. In this case, the command is `ls -l`.

- **`.Output()`**: 
  - This method runs the command and returns the output. The result is captured in the variable `out`.
  - If the command runs successfully, `out` will contain the standard output (the result of running `ls -l`).
  - If there is an error (for example, if the command does not exist or fails for some reason), `err` will contain that error.

- **Error Handling**:
  - The code checks if `err` is not `nil`. If there's an error, it logs the error using `log.Fatal(err)`.
  - `log.Fatal` will print the error and stop the execution of the program (it also calls `os.Exit(1)` to terminate with a non-zero exit code).

- **Printing the Output**:
  - If the command is successful, the output (`out`) is printed to the console using `fmt.Println(string(out))`.
  - `string(out)` is used to convert the byte slice `out` into a string so it can be printed.

### 3. **Main Function:**
```go
func main() {
	CaptureOutput()
}
```
- The `main` function calls `CaptureOutput()`, which executes the system command `ls -l` and prints the output.

### **Explanation of the Output (Example)**:
If you run this Go program, it will print the same output as the `ls -l` command in the terminal, which might look like this:

```
total 4
-rwxrwxrwx 1 user group 1503 Mar 23 14:10 myfile
-rwxrwxrwx 1 user group 1541 Mar 23 14:11 anotherfile
```

This output includes file permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, and the date/time when the file was last modified.

### **Modifying for `ls -la`**:
To run the `ls -la` command instead of `ls -l` (which also shows hidden files), you would modify the `exec.Command` like so:

```go
out, err := exec.Command("ls", "-la").Output()
```

This will give the output of `ls -la`, showing both regular files and hidden files (those starting with a dot, such as `.bashrc`).

---

### **Summary of the Code's Behavior:**
1. The program runs the `ls -l` command using the `exec.Command` function.
2. It captures the output of that command with `.Output()`.
3. If an error occurs, it logs the error and stops the execution.
4. If the command is successful, it prints the output to the console.

This is a simple example of how Go can interact with the system and run shell commands, which is useful when you need to integrate system-level operations into your Go programs.
