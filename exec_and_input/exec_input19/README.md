This Go program implements a simple unpacking function, where input strings in a specific format (such as "x5y2") are transformed by expanding repeated characters. The unpacking logic works similarly to the way a "run-length encoding" might work, but with additional rules for handling special characters (like backslashes) and numeric characters.

### Key Concepts and Rules

1. **Input Format**: The program expects an input string where:
   - Characters may be followed by numbers (e.g., `x5` means `xxxxx`).
   - Characters may be escaped with backslashes (e.g., `\\` for a literal backslash or `\4` to print the number `4`).
   - The string can contain a mix of characters, numbers, and escaped characters.

2. **Unpacking Process**:
   - If a character (like `x`) is followed by a number (like `5`), the character should be repeated the number of times specified (e.g., `x5` should be expanded to `xxxxx`).
   - If a backslash (`\`) appears, it changes how the next character is interpreted:
     - If the character following the backslash is a number (like `\4`), it will treat the number as a literal character and add it as-is.
     - If the character following the backslash is a backslash, it represents a literal backslash (`\\`).
     - If the character following the backslash is a letter or symbol, it’s treated as a normal character, and the backslash is discarded.

3. **Handling Errors**:
   - The program checks for invalid input (e.g., numbers without a character before them) and outputs an error message if the input is not formatted correctly.

### Detailed Breakdown of the Code

#### Constants and Variables

- **Symbol Types**: 
  - `symTypeUndefined`, `symTypeChar`, `symTypeNum`, `symTypeBackslash`: These constants define different types of symbols encountered during the unpacking process.
  - `symZero` and `symNine`: Represent ASCII values for the characters '0' and '9', respectively.
  
- **Variables**:
  - `builder`: A `strings.Builder` to accumulate the unpacked string.
  - `currentSymbol`, `nextPrintSymbol`, `prevSymbol`: Runes (characters) used during the unpacking process.
  - `currentPosition`: Tracks the current position of the character being processed.
  - `prevSymbolType`: Keeps track of the type of the previous symbol (char, number, or backslash).
  - `repeatSymCount`: Tracks how many times a character should be repeated (if followed by a number).

#### The `processSymbol` Function

This function processes each symbol (character or number) in the input string. The main tasks of this function are to decide how to handle different types of symbols and apply the unpacking rules.

- **When encountering a number** (ASCII values between 48 and 57, inclusive):
  - If the previous symbol was a character or number, it updates the `repeatSymCount` (how many times to repeat the character).
  - If the previous symbol was a backslash, it treats the number as a character to be printed literally.

- **When encountering a backslash**:
  - If it appears without a preceding character or number, it marks the backslash as the next symbol type.
  - If a backslash is followed by a number, it repeats the previous symbol (`nextPrintSymbol`) the number of times specified.
  - If it’s followed by a letter or symbol, it treats it as a literal character.
  - If a backslash appears after another backslash, it marks it as a backslash to print the next symbol normally.

- **When encountering a character** (letters or other symbols):
  - If the previous symbol was a number, the character should be printed `repeatSymCount` times.
  - If the previous symbol was a backslash, the program checks for errors and ensures the backslash isn't misused.
  - If the previous symbol was another character, the current character is printed as normal.

#### The `Unpack` Function

This function handles the actual unpacking process:

- It resets the `builder` and variables before processing the string.
- It loops through each character in the input string, calling `processSymbol` to handle each one.
- At the end, the `builder` contains the fully unpacked string, which is returned as the result.

#### Main Function

- The main function checks if an input string has been provided as a command-line argument.
- If no input is provided, it prints an error message and exits.
- If input is provided, it calls the `Unpack` function to unpack the string and print the result.

### Examples and Outputs

#### Example 1: `"x5y2"`
- **Input**: `x5y2`
- **Processing**:
  - `x` is followed by `5` → `xxxxx`
  - `y` is followed by `2` → `yy`
- **Output**: `xxxxx yy`

#### Example 2: `"abc\\4"`
- **Input**: `abc\4`
- **Processing**:
  - `a`, `b`, and `c` are printed normally.
  - The backslash escapes the `4`, treating it as a literal.
- **Output**: `abc4`

#### Example 3: `"1\\2"`
- **Input**: `1\2`
- **Processing**:
  - `1` is treated as the number to repeat the next symbol.
  - `\2` is interpreted as printing the literal `2`.
- **Output**: `12`

#### Example 4: `"abc\\\\3"`
- **Input**: `abc\\3`
- **Processing**:
  - `a`, `b`, and `c` are printed normally.
  - The `\\` represents a literal backslash, followed by `3`.
- **Output**: `abc\3`

#### Example 5: `"h3i2\\5"`
- **Input**: `h3i2\5`
- **Processing**:
  - `h` is followed by `3` → `hhh`
  - `i` is followed by `2` → `ii`
  - `\5` is treated as printing the literal `5`.
- **Output**: `hhhi5`

### Error Handling

The program will exit with an error message if:
- A number appears without a preceding character (e.g., `"3"` is invalid).
- A backslash is used incorrectly (e.g., followed by an invalid symbol).
  
The error handling ensures that the input string is well-formed before attempting to unpack it.

### Summary

- **Unpack Function**: The main function of the program that processes an input string and expands characters based on repeat counts or escape sequences.
- **Special Handling**: Backslashes are used for escaping characters, and numbers following characters are used to indicate how many times to repeat the preceding character.
- **Error Handling**: Provides checks for incorrect input formats, ensuring the string follows the expected pattern for unpacking.
