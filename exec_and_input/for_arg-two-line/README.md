This Go program is designed to perform **two tasks**:

1. **Print all even numbers between two user-defined numbers (`a` and `b`).**
2. **(Partially implemented) Calculate the factorial of a number, but the code for this part is incomplete.**

## âœ… **Step-by-step explanation**

### 1. **Variable Declaration**
```go
var a, b int
```
- Two integer variables `a` and `b` are declared.
- These will be used to store the start and end of the range for even number identification.

---

### 2. **Input Handling**
```go
fmt.Scanf("%d %d", &a, &b)
```
- The `fmt.Scanf()` function reads **two integers** from the user and assigns them to `a` and `b`.
- The format specifier `%d` indicates that the input will be integers.

---

### 3. **For Loop to Identify Even Numbers**
```go
for i := a; i <= b; i++ {
	if i%2 == 0 {
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
}
```
- The `for` loop starts at `i = a` and increments by 1 until `i` reaches `b`.
- The `if` condition `i % 2 == 0` checks if the number is **even** (i.e., divisible by 2).
- If the condition is true, the number `i` is printed.

### ðŸŽ¯ **Example Input and Output**
```
Input:
5 15

Output:
6
8
10
12
14
```

### 4. **Factorial Calculation (Incomplete)**
```go
//5! -> 1*2*3*4*5 = 120
//5
//120
```
- The comments hint that the program was intended to **calculate the factorial of a number**, but the actual code to do this is missing.

---

## âœ… **Summary of Rules**
1. Take two integers as input (`a` and `b`).
2. Use a `for` loop to iterate from `a` to `b`.
3. Use the condition `i % 2 == 0` to check for even numbers.
4. Print the even numbers.
5. The factorial calculation part is incomplete and can be added later.
