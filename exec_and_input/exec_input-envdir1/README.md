This Go program is structured to read environment variables from a specific directory, set them as environment variables, and then execute a shell script using those environment variables. Here's a detailed breakdown of each part of the code:

### Imports:
```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"go_andr_less/12_envdir/runner"
	"os"
)
```
- `fmt`: This package is used for formatted I/O, such as printing to the console.
- `runner`: This is a custom package (which you would need to have defined in your project) that contains the functions `ReadDir` and `RunCmd`. These functions are responsible for reading environment variables from a directory and running a command with those environment variables, respectively.
- `os`: This package provides functions to interact with the operating system, such as getting the current working directory.

### Main function:

#### Get Current Working Directory:
```go
pwd, _ := os.Getwd()
```
- The `os.Getwd()` function returns the current working directory (`pwd`) and an error (`_`). Since error handling is ignored here (`_`), the code assumes that retrieving the working directory is always successful. The working directory is stored in the `pwd` variable as a string.

#### Read Environment Variables:
```go
eVals, err := runner.ReadDir(pwd + "/12_envdir/envdir")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```
- The program calls `runner.ReadDir` with the directory path `"pwd + "/12_envdir/envdir"`, which dynamically builds the path to the `envdir` directory, relative to the current working directory.
- `runner.ReadDir` reads the contents of the `envdir` directory, assuming that each file in that directory represents an environment variable. It returns a map `eVals` where the keys are the filenames (representing the environment variable names), and the values are the contents of those files (representing the environment variable values).
- If an error occurs while reading the directory (`err`), the program panics and terminates.

#### Command to Execute:
```go
cmd := []string{pwd + "/12_envdir/script.sh"}
```
- This line constructs the command that will be run. In this case, the command is the script located at `"pwd + "/12_envdir/script.sh"`, relative to the current working directory.
- The `cmd` variable holds this command as a slice of strings, where the first element is the path to the script and there are no additional arguments to the command.

#### Run the Command:
```go
runner.RunCmd(cmd, eVals)
```
- This line calls the `runner.RunCmd` function, passing it the command to execute (`cmd`) and the environment variables (`eVals`).
  - `runner.RunCmd` sets the environment variables stored in `eVals` using `os.Setenv`, which sets each environment variable for the current process.
  - Then, it runs the command (in this case, the script `script.sh`), waits for it to finish, and logs any errors that occur during the execution of the command.
  
#### Print Environment Variables:
```go
fmt.Printf("env %v, %v", eVals, err)
```
- This line prints the environment variables (`eVals`) and any error that occurred while reading the directory (`err`) to the console. 
  - `eVals` is the map of environment variables read from the `envdir` directory.
  - `err` would be `nil` if there were no errors during reading the directory, or it would contain an error message if an error occurred.

### Summary of Execution:
1. The program begins by obtaining the current working directory.
2. It attempts to read the environment variables from the directory `/12_envdir/envdir` (relative to the current working directory). If successful, it stores them in the `eVals` map.
3. The program constructs the path to a shell script (`script.sh`) in the `/12_envdir/` directory.
4. It then runs the script, setting the environment variables from `eVals` before execution.
5. Finally, it prints out the environment variables and any error that occurred while reading the directory.

### Flow of Program:
1. **Get current directory**: Determine where the Go program is running (`os.Getwd()`).
2. **Read environment variables**: Fetch files from the `envdir` directory using `runner.ReadDir`. These files represent environment variables and their values.
3. **Prepare command**: Define the command (`script.sh`) that will be executed.
4. **Set environment and run command**: Use `runner.RunCmd` to set environment variables and execute the command.
5. **Display results**: Output the environment variables and any errors to the console using `fmt.Printf`.

### Example Directory Structure:
Assuming your current working directory is `/path/to/project`, here’s what the directory structure might look like:

```
/path/to/project/
  └── 12_envdir/
      ├── envdir/
      │   ├── KEY1 -> "value1"
      │   ├── KEY2 -> "value2"
      │   └── KEY3 -> "value3"
      └── script.sh
```

- **`envdir/`**: A directory containing files, each representing an environment variable (e.g., `KEY1`, `KEY2`, `KEY3`).
- **`script.sh`**: A shell script that will be executed, potentially using the environment variables set earlier.

### Expected Output:

- If the `envdir` directory contains files `KEY1`, `KEY2`, and `KEY3` with corresponding values `"value1"`, `"value2"`, and `"value3"`, and the script runs successfully, the output will print the environment variables and any errors to the console.
- The shell script `script.sh` will be executed with the environment variables `KEY1`, `KEY2`, and `KEY3` set to their respective values, and its output will also be displayed.

### Potential Improvements:

1. **Error Handling**: The code could be improved by handling errors more gracefully, especially in the `RunCmd` function (for example, checking if the script exists or if the environment variables are valid).
2. **Logging**: You could add more logging to track which environment variables are being set and which command is being run.
3. **Script Output**: Capture and display the output of the script instead of just logging errors.
