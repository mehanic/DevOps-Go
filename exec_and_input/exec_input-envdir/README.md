Let's break down the Go code and explain the rules behind each section:

### Imports:
```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"go_andr_less/12_envdir/runner"
	"os"
)
```
- **`fmt`**: This is the standard package for formatted I/O in Go. It is used here for printing messages to the console.
- **`go_andr_less/12_envdir/runner`**: This is a custom import, referring to a package within your project. It contains functions like `ReadDir` and `RunCmd`. Since this is part of the user's code, it refers to a specific package that isn't part of the standard Go library.
- **`os`**: The `os` package allows you to interact with the operating system. It's used here for fetching the current working directory.

### Main Function:
```go
func main() {
	pwd, _ := os.Getwd()
```
- **`os.Getwd()`**: This function returns the current working directory (i.e., the directory where the Go program is being run). The result is stored in `pwd`. The second value (an error) is ignored using `_` since the code assumes `os.Getwd()` won't fail.

```go
	eVals, err := runner.ReadDir(pwd + "/12_envdir/envdir")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
```
- **`runner.ReadDir(pwd + "/12_envdir/envdir")`**: 
  - This custom function (`ReadDir`) is called from the `runner` package. 
  - It likely reads the contents of the specified directory (in this case, the path is built dynamically by appending `"/12_envdir/envdir"` to the current working directory).
  - `ReadDir` is expected to return a list of environment variables or configuration values (`eVals`) and an error (`err`).
  - If there is an error reading the directory (e.g., directory does not exist or is inaccessible), the program will panic and stop executing, which is done by the `panic(err)` line.

```go
	cmd := []string{pwd + "/12_envdir/script.sh"}
```
- **`cmd := []string{pwd + "/12_envdir/script.sh"}`**: 
  - This line creates a slice (`cmd`) that contains a single string, which is the absolute path to a shell script (`script.sh`) located in the `12_envdir` folder relative to the current working directory.

```go
	runner.RunCmd(cmd, eVals)
```
- **`runner.RunCmd(cmd, eVals)`**:
  - This function (`RunCmd`) is also defined in the `runner` package.
  - It takes two arguments:
    - `cmd`: The slice containing the command to execute (in this case, the path to `script.sh`).
    - `eVals`: The environment values (likely variables) that were read from the directory.
  - The `RunCmd` function is expected to execute the shell script (`script.sh`) with the provided environment variables (`eVals`).

```go
	fmt.Printf("env %v, %v", eVals, err)
}
```
- **`fmt.Printf("env %v, %v", eVals, err)`**:
  - After running the script, this line prints out the environment variables (`eVals`) and the error (`err`), which could be useful for debugging or logging.
  - **`%v`**: The `%v` format specifier in Go is used to print the default representation of the variable. This will output the value of `eVals` and `err` in their default string formats.

---

### Summary of What the Code Does:
1. **Get the current working directory**: `os.Getwd()` is used to retrieve the current working directory (`pwd`).
2. **Read the environment variables**: The `ReadDir` function in the `runner` package is called to read environment variables (or values) from the directory `pwd + "/12_envdir/envdir"`. If there is an error, the program panics and stops.
3. **Prepare the command**: A slice containing the full path to the `script.sh` file (`pwd + "/12_envdir/script.sh"`) is created.
4. **Run the shell script**: The `RunCmd` function is called, which runs `script.sh` with the environment values (`eVals`) passed to it.
5. **Print the environment variables and error**: After running the script, the environment variables and any potential error are printed.

### What This Code Is Likely Doing:
- **Environment Setup**: The code reads environment variables from a directory (likely a set of key-value pairs) and then executes a shell script with those variables.
- **Executing a Shell Script**: The `script.sh` is probably a shell script that utilizes these environment variables to perform tasks.
- **Error Handling**: If there is any issue with reading the directory or running the script, the program will stop immediately with a panic error.

---

### Points of Interest:
- **Custom Package**: The `runner` package is key here. This package likely defines how to read the environment values and how to run commands/scripts using these values. This code snippet assumes you have a `runner` package with `ReadDir` and `RunCmd` functions already implemented.
  
- **Panic Handling**: The use of `panic(err)` in case of an error from `ReadDir` implies that the program is not designed to continue execution if it can't read the directory, making error handling fairly strict.
