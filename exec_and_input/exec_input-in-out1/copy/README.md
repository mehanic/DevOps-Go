This Go code defines a utility for copying a portion of a file from a source to a destination, with an option to specify an offset (starting point) and a limit (how much of the file to copy). The program uses `flag` to parse command-line arguments and `io.CopyN` to perform the copying operation.

### Breakdown of Code

1. **Variables:**
   ```go
   var source string
   var dest string
   var offset int
   var limit int
   ```
   - `source`: A string variable for the source file path.
   - `dest`: A string variable for the destination file path.
   - `offset`: An integer representing the starting point in the source file to begin reading from.
   - `limit`: An integer representing the number of bytes to copy from the source file.

2. **`init` Function:**
   ```go
   func init() {
       flag.StringVar(&source, "from", "", "file to read from")
       flag.StringVar(&dest, "to", "", "file to write to")
       flag.IntVar(&offset, "offset", 0, "offset in input file")
       flag.IntVar(&limit, "limit", 0, "limit in input file")
   }
   ```
   - The `init` function is called before `main()` and is used to initialize command-line flags.
   - `flag.StringVar` and `flag.IntVar` are used to bind command-line flags (`-from`, `-to`, `-offset`, `-limit`) to the respective variables (`source`, `dest`, `offset`, `limit`).
     - `-from` is the file to read from (source file).
     - `-to` is the file to write to (destination file).
     - `-offset` is the starting point in the source file.
     - `-limit` is the maximum number of bytes to copy from the source.

3. **`Copy` Function:**
   The `Copy` function performs the actual file copying process.

   ```go
   func Copy() {
       flag.Parse()
   ```

   - `flag.Parse()` parses the command-line flags, populating the `source`, `dest`, `offset`, and `limit` variables.

4. **Check for Valid Offset and Limit:**
   ```go
   if limit < offset {
       println("Offset must be less than limit.")
       return
   }
   ```
   - The program checks if the `limit` is less than the `offset`. If this condition is met, it prints an error message and exits early. The `offset` should be less than the `limit` because you can't copy more than what is available in the file.

5. **Open Source File:**
   ```go
   sourceObj, err := os.OpenFile(source, os.O_RDWR, 0644)
   if err != nil {
       if os.IsNotExist(err) {
           log.Panicf("file does not exist: %v", err)
       }
   }
   defer sourceObj.Close()
   ```
   - The source file is opened using `os.OpenFile` with read-write (`os.O_RDWR`) permissions. If the file does not exist, the program logs a panic message and exits.
   - `defer sourceObj.Close()` ensures that the source file is properly closed when the function exits.

6. **Seek to Offset in Source File:**
   ```go
   sourceObj.Seek(int64(offset), io.SeekStart)
   ```
   - The `Seek` function moves the file pointer to the position specified by the `offset`. The `io.SeekStart` tells the program to seek from the beginning of the file.

7. **Create Destination File:**
   ```go
   destObj, err := os.Create(dest)
   if err != nil {
       if os.IsExist(err) {
           log.Panicf("file already exists: %v", err)
       }
   }
   defer destObj.Close()
   ```
   - The destination file is created using `os.Create`. If the file already exists, the program logs a panic message and exits.
   - `defer destObj.Close()` ensures that the destination file is properly closed when the function exits.

8. **Copy Data in Chunks:**
   ```go
   done := 0
   n := 1024
   for done < limit-offset {
       if (done + n) > limit-offset {
           n = limit - offset - done
       }
       written, err := io.CopyN(destObj, sourceObj, int64(n))
       done += n
       fmt.Printf("Done: %d\n", done)
       if err != nil {
           if err == io.EOF {
               fmt.Printf("End of file, written: %d\n", written)
               break
           }
           log.Panicf("can't copy: %v", err)
       }
       fmt.Printf("written : %d\n", written)
   }
   ```

   - The copying is done in chunks of 1024 bytes (1 KB) using `io.CopyN`, which copies a specified number of bytes (`n`) from the source to the destination.
   - The variable `done` tracks the number of bytes that have been copied so far.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It checks if the remaining bytes to copy are less than the chunk size `n`. If so, it adjusts `n` to copy only the remaining bytes (`limit - offset - done`).
     - `io.CopyN` is used to copy the data from the source file (`sourceObj`) to the destination file (`destObj`).
     - If `err` is `io.EOF`, the program logs that the end of the file has been reached and exits the loop. If any other error occurs, the program logs it and exits.

9. **Output the Progress:**
   ```go
   fmt.Printf("Done: %d\n", done)
   fmt.Printf("written : %d\n", written)
   ```

   - It prints the progress of copying, showing how many bytes have been copied (`done`), and how many bytes were written in the last chunk (`written`).

### Summary of Logic:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes flags using `flag` package to get input parameters: source file, destination file, offset, and limit.
2. **Validation**: It checks if the `limit` is greater than `offset` to ensure valid arguments.
3. **Opening Files**: The source file is opened for reading, and the destination file is created for writing.
4. **Copying in Chunks**: Data is copied in chunks of 1024 bytes from the source file to the destination file, starting at the `offset` position and stopping when the `limit` is reached.
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is implemented for file access and copying errors.
6. **Progress Reporting**: The program prints progress and status of the copying process.

### Example Command-Line Usage:
If you want to copy from `file1.txt` to `file2.txt`, starting from byte 100 and copying a total of 500 bytes, you would run the program as follows:
```bash
go run main.go -from="file1.txt" -to="file2.txt" -offset=100 -limit=500
```

This would:
- Open `file1.txt` for reading.
- Start reading from byte 100.
- Copy 500 bytes from `file1.txt` to `file2.txt`.
