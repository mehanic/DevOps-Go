The Go program you've provided is an example of using slices and dynamically appending elements to a slice. Let's break down the code and explain it in detail:

### **Code Explanation:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	n := 5                  // Declare a variable n, which is the number of elements to be input
	a := []int{}            // Declare an empty slice of integers a

	// Loop to accept input for 'n' times
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		var k int            // Declare a temporary variable k to store input
		fmt.Scan(&k)         // Read an integer input from the user and store it in k
		a = append(a, k)     // Append the value of k to the slice a
	}

	fmt.Println(a)          // Print the resulting slice after all inputs
}
```

### **Step-by-step Breakdown:**

1. **Declaration of Variables:**
   ```go
   n := 5
   a := []int{}
   ```
   - `n := 5`: This sets the variable `n` to `5`, which defines the number of integers the program will take as input from the user.
   - `a := []int{}`: This creates an empty slice `a` of type `int`. A slice in Go is a dynamic, flexible view into an array. Here, we initialize it as an empty slice.

2. **Loop for User Input:**
   ```go
   for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
       var k int
       fmt.Scan(&k)
       a = append(a, k)
   }
   ```
   - This is a `for` loop that will run `n` times (5 iterations in this case).
   - Inside the loop:
     - `var k int`: Declares a temporary integer variable `k` that will hold each user input.
     - `fmt.Scan(&k)`: This reads an integer from the standard input (keyboard) and stores it in the variable `k`.
     - `a = append(a, k)`: This appends the value of `k` to the slice `a`. The `append` function dynamically increases the size of the slice and adds the element at the end. This is how slices grow in Go.

3. **Printing the Slice:**
   ```go
   fmt.Println(a)
   ```
   - After the loop completes (i.e., after 5 numbers have been added to the slice), the program prints the slice `a`. At this point, `a` contains the `5` integers that the user inputted.

### **Example Run:**

Let's say the user inputs the following numbers:

```
3
7
1
4
9
```

During each iteration of the loop:
- On the 1st iteration, `k = 3`, and the slice becomes `[3]`.
- On the 2nd iteration, `k = 7`, and the slice becomes `[3, 7]`.
- On the 3rd iteration, `k = 1`, and the slice becomes `[3, 7, 1]`.
- On the 4th iteration, `k = 4`, and the slice becomes `[3, 7, 1, 4]`.
- On the 5th iteration, `k = 9`, and the slice becomes `[3, 7, 1, 4, 9]`.

Finally, the program prints:
```
[3 7 1 4 9]
```

### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Slice in Go**:
   - A **slice** is a flexible and dynamic array-like structure in Go.
   - It is different from an array in that its size can change during runtime, which is why `append` is used to grow the slice.

2. **Using `append()`**:
   - The `append()` function is used to add elements to the slice. It creates a new slice with the added element and returns it. You need to store the result of `append()` back into the slice variable because slices in Go are reference types.

3. **Input from User**:
   - The program uses `fmt.Scan(&k)` to read an integer from the user input.

### **Output:**
If the user inputs the numbers `3`, `7`, `1`, `4`, `9`, the output will be:
```
[3 7 1 4 9]
```

### **Summary:**
- The program initializes an empty slice and accepts `n` integers from the user.
- Each input is appended to the slice dynamically.
- Finally, the program prints the slice with the integers entered by the user.
