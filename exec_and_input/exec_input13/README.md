### **Explanation of the Code: A Simple Command-Line Application in Go**

This Go program is a simple **command-line interface (CLI)** that simulates a terminal environment, where the user can run commands like `exit`, `help`, `shuffle`, and `print`. Each command has a specific behavior, and the program reads and processes commands entered by the user.

Here is a breakdown of the key components and how they work:

---

### **1. `cmd` Struct:**
The `cmd` struct defines a command, which includes:
- **Name**: The name of the command (e.g., "exit", "help").
- **Help**: A short description of what the command does.
- **Action**: A function that is executed when the command is called. The function takes an `io.Writer` to write output and a list of arguments (`args`) passed by the user when running the command.

```go
type cmd struct {
    Name   string
    Help   string
    Action func(w io.Writer, args ...string) bool
}
```

Each command has an associated `Action` function that will handle the command's logic when invoked.

---

### **2. `init()` Function:**
The `init()` function initializes a slice of `cmd` (commands) and populates it with predefined commands such as `exit`, `help`, `shuffle`, and `print`.

- **`exit`**: Exits the program.
- **`help`**: Lists all available commands.
- **`shuffle`**: Shuffles the list of strings passed as arguments.
- **`print`**: Prints the contents of a specified file.

```go
func init() {
    cmds = append(cmds,
        cmd{
            Name: "exit",
            Help: "Exits the application",
            Action: func(w io.Writer, args ...string) bool {
                fmt.Fprintf(w, "Goodbye! :)\n")
                return true
            },
        },
        cmd{
            Name: "help",
            Help: "Shows available commands",
            Action: func(w io.Writer, args ...string) bool {
                fmt.Fprintln(w, "Available commands:")
                for _, c := range cmds {
                    fmt.Fprintf(w, "  - %-15s %s\n", c.Name, c.Help)
                }
                return false
            },
        },
        cmd{
            Name: "shuffle",
            Help: "Shuffles a list of strings",
            Action: func(w io.Writer, args ...string) bool {
                rand.Shuffle(len(args), func(i, j int) {
                    args[i], args[j] = args[j], args[i]
                })
                for i := range args {
                    if i > 0 {
                        fmt.Fprint(w, " ")
                    }
                    fmt.Fprintf(w, "%s", args[i])
                }
                fmt.Fprintln(w)
                return false
            },
        },
        cmd{
            Name: "print",
            Help: "Prints a file",
            Action: func(w io.Writer, args ...string) bool {
                if len(args) != 1 {
                    fmt.Fprintln(w, "Please specify one file!")
                    return false
                }
                f, err := os.Open(args[0])
                if err != nil {
                    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Cannot open %s: %s\n", args[0], err)
                }
                defer f.Close()
                if _, err := io.Copy(w, f); err != nil {
                    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Cannot print %s: %s\n", args[0], err)
                }
                fmt.Fprintln(w)
                return false
            },
        },
    )
}
```

### **Explanation of Commands:**
- **`exit`**: When called, prints "Goodbye!" and exits the program (returns `true` to indicate the program should exit).
- **`help`**: Lists all available commands and their descriptions.
- **`shuffle`**: Takes a list of strings as arguments, shuffles them, and prints them in a random order.
- **`print`**: Prints the contents of a specified file. If the file isn't specified or cannot be opened, it returns an error.

---

### **3. `main()` Function:**
The `main()` function contains the logic for running the command-line interface (CLI).

- **Scanner Setup**: It creates a `bufio.Scanner` to read user input from the standard input (`os.Stdin`).
- **Prompting User**: It continuously prompts the user with the current working directory and waits for commands.
- **Processing Commands**: Once the user enters a command:
  - The input is split into arguments.
  - The program loops through the registered commands (`cmds`) to find a match for the entered command.
  - If the command is found, it calls the associated `Action` function.
  - If the `exit` command is executed, the program terminates. Otherwise, it continues to accept commands.

```go
func main() {
    s := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
    w := os.Stdout
    fmt.Fprint(w, "** Welcome to PseudoTerm! **\nPlease enter a command.\n")
    for {
        pwd, err := os.Getwd()
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("Cannot get working directory:", err)
            return
        }
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "\n[%s] > ", filepath.Base(pwd))
        if !s.Scan() {
            continue
        }
        args := strings.Split(string(s.Bytes()), " ")
        idx := -1
        for i := range cmds {
            if !cmds[i].Match(args[0]) {
                continue
            }
            idx = i
            break
        }
        if idx == -1 {
            fmt.Fprintf(w, "%q not found. Use `help` for available commands\n", args[0])
            continue
        }
        if cmds[idx].Run(w, args[1:]...) {
            fmt.Fprintln(w)
            return
        }
    }
}
```

### **Steps in the `main()` function:**
1. **Greeting**: The program greets the user and asks them to enter a command.
2. **Command Loop**: The program continuously:
   - Displays the current working directory.
   - Reads the user input.
   - Splits the input into a command name and arguments.
   - Searches for a matching command in the list of available commands.
   - Executes the command by calling the corresponding `Action`.
3. **Command Execution**: If the command is not found, the program prints an error message. If found, the appropriate action is executed.

---

### **Key Operations:**
- **`cmd.Match(s string)`**: Compares the command name with the input string.
- **`cmd.Run(w io.Writer, args ...string)`**: Executes the `Action` associated with the command.

---

### **Sample Interaction:**

1. **Start the program:**

```
** Welcome to PseudoTerm! **
Please enter a command.
```

2. **User enters the `help` command:**

```
[exec_input-project-spam-masker-step-2-no-append] > help
Available commands:
  - exit            Exits the application
  - help            Shows available commands
  - shuffle         Shuffles a list of strings
  - print           Prints a file
```

3. **User enters an unrecognized command (`ls`):**

```
[exec_input-project-spam-masker-step-2-no-append] > ls
"ls" not found. Use `help` for available commands
```

4. **User enters the `shuffle` command:**

```
[exec_input-project-spam-masker-step-2-no-append] > shuffle apple banana cherry
cherry apple banana
```

5. **User enters the `print` command without specifying a file:**

```
[exec_input-project-spam-masker-step-2-no-append] > print
Please specify one file!
```

---

### **Summary:**
- This Go program implements a basic command-line interface with predefined commands.
- It uses `cmd` structs to define commands and their actions.
- It provides a loop to interact with the user, processes commands, and handles basic file operations and shuffling of arguments.
- Commands include `exit`, `help`, `shuffle`, and `print`, and the program can be easily extended by adding more commands to the `cmds` slice.
