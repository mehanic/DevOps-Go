## **Explanation of the Go Program: Running Multiple Arguments with `exec.Command`**

This Go program demonstrates how to run an external command with multiple arguments, in this case, using the `echo` command, which outputs text to the console.

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

### **1. Declaring the Command and Arguments**
```go
prg := "echo"
arg1 := "there"
arg2 := "are slurms"
arg3 := "in Slurmland"
```
- `prg := "echo"`: This specifies the command to run, which is the Unix `echo` command. The `echo` command prints text to the standard output.
- The arguments (`arg1`, `arg2`, `arg3`) specify the text that will be printed by `echo`. In this case, the program will print:
  - `there`
  - `are slurms`
  - `in Slurmland`

---

### **2. Setting Up the Command Execution**
```go
cmd := exec.Command(prg, arg1, arg2, arg3)
```
- `exec.Command(prg, arg1, arg2, arg3)` creates a new command, which is the `echo` program, and passes the arguments `arg1`, `arg2`, and `arg3` to it.
- This means the `echo` command will receive these arguments and print them.

---

### **3. Running the Command and Capturing Output**
```go
stdout, err := cmd.Output()
```
- `cmd.Output()` runs the command (`echo`) and **captures its output** (the text printed by `echo`).
- The output is stored in `stdout`, and if thereâ€™s an error during execution, it will be stored in `err`.

---

### **4. Error Handling**
```go
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err.Error())
    return
}
```
- If an error occurs during the execution of `cmd`, it will be printed using `fmt.Println(err.Error())`, and the program will stop with the `return` statement.
- `err` could occur if, for example, the `echo` command is unavailable or incorrect arguments are passed.

---

### **5. Printing the Output**
```go
fmt.Print(string(stdout))
```
- Finally, the output of the command (`stdout`) is converted into a string using `string(stdout)` and printed to the console.

---

### **Final Output**
```
there are slurms in Slurmland
```
- The command `echo` prints the arguments (`there`, `are slurms`, `in Slurmland`) to the terminal, which are combined into a single line: `"there are slurms in Slurmland"`.

---

### **Key Concepts**
1. **exec.Command**: A function that creates a new command with the specified arguments.
2. **cmd.Output()**: Runs the command and captures the output (the result of the command).
3. **Error handling**: If any error occurs during command execution, it's caught and printed.
4. **Output**: The output of the command is returned as a byte slice and then printed as a string.

---

### **Takeaways**
- You can pass multiple arguments to external commands like `echo`, `ls`, `grep`, etc., and capture their outputs.
- This method can be adapted for a variety of system commands or scripts that require arguments.
