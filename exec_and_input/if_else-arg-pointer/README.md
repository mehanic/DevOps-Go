### **Explanation of the Code**

This program takes two integer inputs, calculates their sum, and then checks if the sum is greater than or equal to 10 or less than 10, printing a message based on the result.

---

## **📌 Code Breakdown**

### **1️⃣ Importing Required Package**
```go
import "fmt"
```
- The `fmt` package is used for formatted I/O operations in Go. Specifically, it is used here to handle user input and output.

---

### **2️⃣ Declaring Variables**
```go
var a, b int
```
- Two integer variables, `a` and `b`, are declared. These will store the two numbers that the user will input.

---

### **3️⃣ Taking User Input**
```go
fmt.Scanf("%d", &a)
fmt.Scanf("%d", &b)
```
- `fmt.Scanf` is used to read user input. 
- `%d` specifies that the input should be an integer (decimal).
- `&a` and `&b` are **pointers** to the variables `a` and `b`, meaning that the values entered by the user will be stored in these variables.

For example, if the user enters:
```
6
19
```
The values `6` and `19` are assigned to `a` and `b` respectively.

---

### **4️⃣ Calculating the Sum**
```go
c := a + b
```
- This line calculates the **sum** of `a` and `b` and stores it in a new variable `c`.

If the inputs were `6` and `19`, the result would be:
```
c = 6 + 19 = 25
```

---

### **5️⃣ Conditional Check Using `if-else`**
```go
if c > 10 {
	fmt.Println(">=10")
} else {
	fmt.Println("<10")
}
```
- The program checks whether `c` (the sum of `a` and `b`) is **greater than 10**.
- If `c > 10`, it prints:
  ```
  >=10
  ```
- If `c <= 10`, it prints:
  ```
  <10
  ```

In our example, the sum `c = 25` (which is greater than 10), so the output will be:
```
>=10
```

---

### **6️⃣ Operators**
The condition inside the `if` statement uses comparison operators:
- `>`: Greater than.
- `<`: Less than.
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to.
- `<=`: Less than or equal to.
- `==`: Equal to.
- `!=`: Not equal to.

These operators are used to compare the value of `c` with 10 to determine which message to print.

### **🔹 Example Input and Output**

#### **Input 1:**
```
6
19
```

#### **Process:**
1. The program takes two inputs: `6` and `19`.
2. It calculates the sum: `c = 6 + 19 = 25`.
3. Since `25 > 10`, it prints:
   ```
   >=10
   ```

#### **Input 2:**
```
4
5
```

#### **Process:**
1. The program takes two inputs: `4` and `5`.
2. It calculates the sum: `c = 4 + 5 = 9`.
3. Since `9 <= 10`, it prints:
   ```
   <10
   ```

---

### **🔹 Key Points to Remember:**

1. **Input Handling**: `fmt.Scanf` is used to read user input, and the format `%d` is used for integers.
2. **Comparison Operators**: Comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`) are used to compare the sum with 10.
3. **Conditional Statements**: An `if-else` block is used to print different messages based on the value of `c`.
