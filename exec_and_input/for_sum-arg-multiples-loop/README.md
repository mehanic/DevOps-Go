This Go program calculates the sum of all numbers below a given number `n` that are divisible by 3 or 5. Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Package Imports**:
   ```go
   import (
       "fmt"
       "os"
   )
   ```
   - `fmt`: This package is used for input and output. Specifically, `fmt.Print()` and `fmt.Scan()` are used to display messages to the user and take input from the user.
   - `os`: The `os` package is used to handle errors. Here, it's used for printing error messages and exiting the program if necessary.

2. **Input from User**:
   ```go
   var n uint
   fmt.Print("Input a number: ")
   if _, err := fmt.Scan(&n); err != nil {
       fmt.Fprint(os.Stderr, err)
       os.Exit(1)
   }
   ```
   - `var n uint`: This declares a variable `n` of type `uint` (unsigned integer), which will store the user's input number.
   - `fmt.Print("Input a number: ")`: This prints a prompt asking the user to input a number.
   - `fmt.Scan(&n)`: This reads the input from the user and stores it in the variable `n`.
   - If there's an error during input (e.g., the user enters non-numeric data), the program prints the error message to `os.Stderr` and then exits with `os.Exit(1)`.

3. **Initialization of the Sum**:
   ```go
   var sum uint
   ```
   - This declares a variable `sum` of type `uint` that will store the sum of all numbers below `n` that are divisible by either 3 or 5.

4. **For Loop to Iterate Through Numbers Below `n`**:
   ```go
   for i := uint(1); i < n; i++ {
       if i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0 {
           sum += i
       }
   }
   ```
   - `for i := uint(1); i < n; i++`: This loop starts at 1 and continues until `i` is less than `n`, incrementing `i` by 1 on each iteration.
   - Inside the loop, the condition `if i % 3 == 0 || i % 5 == 0` checks whether the current number `i` is divisible by 3 or 5:
     - `i % 3 == 0`: This checks if `i` is divisible by 3.
     - `i % 5 == 0`: This checks if `i` is divisible by 5.
     - If either condition is true, the number `i` is added to `sum` using `sum += i`.
   - The program thus sums all the numbers that are divisible by 3 or 5 below `n`.

5. **Output the Result**:
   ```go
   fmt.Println("Sum of 3|5 multiples below:", sum)
   ```
   - This prints the final result: the sum of all numbers below `n` that are divisible by 3 or 5.

### Example:
Let's walk through an example. Suppose the user inputs `n = 10`.

- The program will check the numbers less than 10:
  - `1 % 3 != 0` and `1 % 5 != 0`
  - `2 % 3 != 0` and `2 % 5 != 0`
  - `3 % 3 == 0` (so `sum += 3`)
  - `4 % 3 != 0` and `4 % 5 != 0`
  - `5 % 3 != 0` and `5 % 5 == 0` (so `sum += 5`)
  - `6 % 3 == 0` (so `sum += 6`)
  - `7 % 3 != 0` and `7 % 5 != 0`
  - `8 % 3 != 0` and `8 % 5 != 0`
  - `9 % 3 == 0` (so `sum += 9`)

So the numbers that are divisible by 3 or 5 below 10 are `3`, `5`, `6`, and `9`. The sum is `3 + 5 + 6 + 9 = 23`, and the output will be:
```
Sum of 3|5 multiples below: 23
```

### Error Handling:
- If the user enters an invalid input (such as a non-number), the program will print the error to the standard error output and exit with a status code of 1.

### Summary of the Key Rules:
- The program takes a user input (`n`) and calculates the sum of all numbers less than `n` that are divisible by either 3 or 5.
- It uses a `for` loop to iterate through all numbers from 1 to `n-1`.
- For each number, it checks if it is divisible by 3 or 5 using the modulo operator (`%`).
- If a number is divisible by 3 or 5, it is added to the `sum`.
- The program then prints the result.

This program efficiently calculates the desired sum and handles errors in user input appropriately.
