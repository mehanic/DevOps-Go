### **Explanation of the Code: Running a Simple Application (Firefox) using `exec.Command`**

This Go program demonstrates how to run a simple external application, in this case, the Firefox browser, using the `exec` package. The process involves executing a command, handling errors, and running the application.

---

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

#### **1. The `exec.Command` Function**
```go
cmd := exec.Command("firefox")
```
- **`exec.Command("firefox")`**: This creates a new command to run the `firefox` application. The string `"firefox"` refers to the application name (which is expected to be in the system's `PATH`).
- The `exec.Command` function prepares the command for execution. In this case, it prepares the command to run Firefox.
  
  - If you're on a Linux or macOS system, it expects that `firefox` is an executable available in your system's PATH.
  - On Windows, the same command could be used as long as Firefox is installed and the executable is in the system PATH.

#### **2. Running the Command**
```go
err := cmd.Run()
```
- **`cmd.Run()`**: This function actually executes the command that was set up with `exec.Command`. In this case, it tries to run Firefox.
  
  - The function waits for the command to finish execution, and it also returns any error that occurred while executing the command.
  - If the command completes successfully, the `err` will be `nil`.
  - If there's an error (e.g., the program is not installed, or there's an issue launching it), `err` will contain the error details.

#### **3. Error Handling**
```go
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
```
- **Error Check**: After running the command, the program checks if `err` is not `nil`.
- If `err` is not `nil`, it means that something went wrong when trying to run the command (for example, Firefox was not found in the system PATH).
- **`log.Fatal(err)`**: If an error occurred, the program logs the error and terminates. `log.Fatal` prints the error message to the standard error output and then exits the program with a non-zero status.

### **What Happens When You Run the Program:**
1. **The program starts** by calling `RunSimpleApp()`.
2. **The `exec.Command("firefox")` prepares** to run the Firefox browser.
3. **`cmd.Run()` attempts to run** the `firefox` command.
   - If Firefox is installed and available in the system's PATH, the browser opens.
   - If Firefox is not installed or the system can't find it, the program logs the error and exits.

### **Why This Works:**
- The `exec` package is used to execute external commands from within a Go program.
- The `firefox` command works because it's an external program available in the system's PATH. By calling `exec.Command("firefox")`, the Go program can run it as if you were typing the command manually in a terminal.
- Error handling is included to ensure that the program fails gracefully if Firefox cannot be found or opened.

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Running External Applications**: The `exec.Command` function is used to run external applications from within your Go program.
- **Error Handling**: It's crucial to handle errors that may occur when running external commands. This prevents your program from silently failing and gives useful error messages.
- **Cross-Platform**: The command (`"firefox"`) must be in the system's PATH, and the program will work across different operating systems (as long as the app is available).
