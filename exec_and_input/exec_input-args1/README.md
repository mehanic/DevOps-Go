The Go program you provided demonstrates how to work with **command-line arguments** passed to the program via `os.Args`. Let's break it down and explain each part of the program and the rules behind it.

### Breakdown of the Code:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	var name string

	// assign a new value to the string variable below
	name = os.Args[1]
	fmt.Println("Hello great", name, "!")

	// changes the name, declares the age with 85
	name, age := "gandalf", 85

	fmt.Println("My name is", name)
	fmt.Println("My age is", age)
	fmt.Println("BTW, you shall pass!")
}
```

### 1. **`package main` and `import` Statements**:
```go
package main
import (
	"fmt"
	"os"
)
```
- `package main` indicates that this is a standalone executable Go program (not a library or package).
- `import` includes the standard `fmt` package for formatted I/O (printing) and the `os` package for accessing command-line arguments.

### 2. **Variable Declaration and Command-Line Argument (`os.Args`)**:
```go
var name string
name = os.Args[1]
fmt.Println("Hello great", name, "!")
```
- `var name string`: This line declares a variable `name` of type `string`.
- `name = os.Args[1]`: This retrieves the **first command-line argument** (`os.Args[1]`). `os.Args` is a slice where `os.Args[0]` is the name of the program itself, and `os.Args[1]` is the first user-supplied argument when the program is run. 
  - For example, when you run `go run exec_input-args1/main.go arg0`, `os.Args[0]` would be the program name (`main.go`), and `os.Args[1]` would be the string `"arg0"`, which is the first argument passed to the program.
- `fmt.Println("Hello great", name, "!")`: This prints a greeting to the console. If the argument passed is `"arg0"`, the output will be: `Hello great arg0 !`.

### 3. **Reassigning the Variable and Declaring a New One**:
```go
name, age := "gandalf", 85
```
- Here, the `name` variable is reassigned the value `"gandalf"`, and a new variable `age` is **declared and initialized** with the value `85`.
- The **short variable declaration** (`:=`) allows you to declare and assign values to variables in a single line. It is a shorthand for declaring variables without specifying their type explicitly. 
  - In this case, Go automatically infers that `name` is a `string` and `age` is an `int` based on the values assigned to them.
  - This line **overrides** the previous value of `name` (which was set to the command-line argument) with the new string `"gandalf"`. `age` is a new variable introduced in this line and is set to `85`.

### 4. **Printing the New Values**:
```go
fmt.Println("My name is", name)
fmt.Println("My age is", age)
fmt.Println("BTW, you shall pass!")
```
- These `fmt.Println` statements print out:
  - The updated value of `name`, which is now `"gandalf"`.
  - The value of `age`, which is `85`.
  - A static message `"BTW, you shall pass!"`.

### 5. **Example Run**:
When you run the program with:
```bash
go run exec_input-args1/main.go arg0
```
The program will produce the following output:
```
Hello great arg0 !
My name is gandalf
My age is 85
BTW, you shall pass!
```

- **`os.Args[1]`**: The program prints `"Hello great arg0 !"`, where `"arg0"` is the command-line argument passed when running the program.
- After reassigning the variable `name` to `"gandalf"` and declaring `age` as `85`, it prints:
  - `"My name is gandalf"`
  - `"My age is 85"`
  - `"BTW, you shall pass!"`

### Explanation of the Rules:

1. **Command-Line Arguments (`os.Args`)**:
   - `os.Args` is a slice that holds the command-line arguments. 
   - `os.Args[0]` is always the name of the program (the file you ran), and `os.Args[1]` is the first user-supplied argument (if any).
   - `os.Args` is useful when you need to take user inputs from the command line at the time of execution rather than prompting interactively during the program's run.

2. **Variable Declaration and Assignment**:
   - `var name string`: Declares a variable `name` of type `string`.
   - `name = os.Args[1]`: Assigns the first command-line argument to `name`.
   - `name, age := "gandalf", 85`: Reassigns `name` to `"gandalf"` and declares a new variable `age` with the value `85`. This demonstrates how you can update the value of a previously declared variable and create new variables at the same time using the shorthand declaration `:=`.

3. **Output**:
   - `fmt.Println` is used to print information to the terminal. Each call to `fmt.Println` prints a line with the specified values.

### Conclusion:
The program demonstrates the following key concepts in Go:
- Reading **command-line arguments** using `os.Args`.
- **Variable reassignment** and **declaration** using `:=`.
- Printing output to the console using `fmt.Println`.

It is a simple but effective way to handle input from the user at the time of program execution and to demonstrate how you can modify and manage variables within your program.
