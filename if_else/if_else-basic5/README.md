The Go program you've shared is implementing a custom version of the **floor function**. The **floor** function, in mathematics, returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number. In other words, it rounds a number **down** to the nearest integer.

Let's break down the logic and rules of your code:

### Function `Floor(a float64) int`

This function is designed to return the "floor" of a floating-point number `a`, but it is implemented manually. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

#### 1. **Positive Numbers Case**:
```go
if a > 0 {
    return int(a)
}
```
- **Explanation**: If the input number `a` is **positive**, the function simply converts it to an integer using `int(a)`. This operation will truncate the decimal part, effectively rounding the number down. For example:
  - If `a = 3.7`, `int(3.7)` will return `3`.
  - If `a = 5.9`, `int(5.9)` will return `5`.

#### 2. **Negative Numbers Case**:
```go
return int(a) - 1
```
- **Explanation**: If the number `a` is **negative**, the function subtracts 1 after converting it to an integer. This is done because the default behavior of type conversion (`int(a)`) in Go for negative numbers is to truncate towards zero. This means that:
  - For `a = -18.8`, converting `a` to an integer will give `-18`, but the **floor** function should give `-19` (the largest integer less than or equal to `-18.8`).
  - Therefore, the function corrects this by subtracting `1` from `int(a)` to make sure it rounds **down** correctly for negative numbers.

#### Example:

Let's walk through an example to see how this works:

- **Input**: `-18.8`
  - First, the function checks if the number is positive or negative. Since `-18.8` is negative, it moves to the second case.
  - It converts `-18.8` to an integer using `int(-18.8)`, which results in `-18`.
  - Then, it subtracts `1` from `-18`, which gives `-19`.
  - The function returns `-19`, which is the correct floor value for `-18.8`.

### Main Function:
```go
func main() {
    fmt.Println(Floor(-18.8))
}
```
- **Explanation**: The `main` function calls `Floor(-18.8)` and prints the result. Based on the logic explained above, the expected output is `-19`.

### Summary of the Rules:
- **Positive Numbers**: If the number is positive, the function converts it to an integer, which truncates the decimal part and gives the floor value (rounding down).
- **Negative Numbers**: If the number is negative, the function subtracts `1` after converting it to an integer to ensure the floor is rounded correctly (since Go truncates towards zero for negative numbers).
- **Floor Function**: The function calculates the largest integer that is **less than or equal** to the given number.

### Output:
When running `fmt.Println(Floor(-18.8))`, the output will be:
```
-19
```

This is because the floor of `-18.8` is `-19`, as it is the largest integer less than or equal to `-18.8`.
