Let's break down the code step by step to explain the logic:

### **Code Breakdown:**
```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	x := 40
	if x == 40 {
		fmt.Println("x value is 40")
	} else if x == 41 {
		fmt.Println("x value is not 41")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("x value was not 40 or 41")
	}
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Variable Declaration:**
   ```go
   x := 40
   ```
   - This line declares a variable `x` and assigns it the value of `40`.

2. **If-Else Statement:**
   - The program checks the value of `x` and prints different messages based on the condition that is true.

   **First Condition:**
   ```go
   if x == 40 {
       fmt.Println("x value is 40")
   }
   ```
   - The `if` statement checks if `x` is equal to `40`.
   - Since `x` is `40`, this condition **evaluates to true**, and the program will execute the block inside this `if` statement, printing:
     ```plaintext
     x value is 40
     ```

   **Second Condition (Else-If):**
   ```go
   } else if x == 41 {
       fmt.Println("x value is not 41")
   }
   ```
   - This block is only checked if the previous `if` condition (`x == 40`) was false.
   - Since `x` is not equal to `41`, this condition is **not true**, so the program will skip this part.

   **Else Condition:**
   ```go
   } else {
       fmt.Println("x value was not 40 or 41")
   }
   ```
   - This block is executed only if none of the previous `if` or `else if` conditions are true.
   - Since the value of `x` is `40` and the second condition was skipped, the program doesn't reach this part.

### **Final Output:**
Since the first `if` condition (`x == 40`) is true, the program will print:
```plaintext
x value is 40
```

### **Summary of Rules:**
- **If-Else Statement Structure:**
  - The `if-else` statement checks conditions in a sequence.
  - It first evaluates the `if` condition.
  - If the `if` condition is `false`, it moves on to check the `else if` conditions.
  - If all `if` and `else if` conditions are `false`, the `else` block is executed.

- **In this case:**
  - `x == 40` is true, so the program prints `"x value is 40"`.
  - The `else if` and `else` blocks are skipped because the first condition already matched.

This is a basic conditional check in Go that ensures different actions are taken depending on the value of the variable `x`.
