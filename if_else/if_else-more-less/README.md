Let's break down the code and explain the rules of the conditional checks and flow:

### **Code Breakdown:**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a, b int
	fmt.Scanf("%d %d", &a, &b)  // Read two integers from user input

	if a > b {
		fmt.Println("a>b")  // If a is greater than b, print "a>b"
	} else if a == b {
		fmt.Println("a=b")  // If a is equal to b, print "a=b"
	} else {
		fmt.Println("a<b")  // If a is less than b, print "a<b"
	}
	//cycle
}
```

### **Explanation:**

1. **Input:**
   - The code first uses `fmt.Scanf` to read two integers from user input, which are stored in the variables `a` and `b`. 
   - The format string `"%d %d"` expects two integers to be inputted, separated by spaces (or entered on separate lines).
   - Example input: `5 10` (where `a = 5` and `b = 10`).

2. **Conditional Statements (if, else if, else):**

   The program uses conditional statements to compare the values of `a` and `b` and determine which condition is true. 

   - **First condition: `if a > b`**
     ```go
     if a > b {
         fmt.Println("a>b")
     }
     ```
     - This checks if `a` is greater than `b`.
     - If `a` is indeed greater than `b`, the program will print `"a>b"`.
     - If this condition is false, it moves to the next condition (`else if`).

   - **Second condition: `else if a == b`**
     ```go
     else if a == b {
         fmt.Println("a=b")
     }
     ```
     - This checks if `a` is equal to `b`.
     - If `a` is equal to `b`, it will print `"a=b"`.
     - If this condition is false, it moves to the `else` block.

   - **Third condition: `else`**
     ```go
     else {
         fmt.Println("a<b")
     }
     ```
     - If neither of the previous conditions is true (i.e., `a` is not greater than or equal to `b`), the `else` block will execute.
     - This means that `a` must be less than `b`, and the program will print `"a<b"`.

### **Examples:**

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `5 10`
  - `a = 5`, `b = 10`
  - The condition `a > b` is false, so it moves to the `else if a == b` condition.
  - The condition `a == b` is also false, so the `else` block is executed.
  - Output: `a<b`

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `15 10`
  - `a = 15`, `b = 10`
  - The condition `a > b` is true, so the program prints `a>b`.
  - Output: `a>b`

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `7 7`
  - `a = 7`, `b = 7`
  - The condition `a > b` is false, and `a == b` is true.
  - The program prints `a=b`.
  - Output: `a=b`

### **Flow:**

1. The program first compares `a` with `b`:
   - If `a > b`, it prints `"a>b"`.
   - If `a == b`, it prints `"a=b"`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `"a<b"`.

2. The conditional statements follow the flow:
   - If the first condition is true, it stops there and does not check the others.
   - If the first condition is false, it checks the second condition.
   - If both conditions are false, it executes the `else` block.

### **Summary:**
- The program compares two integers and outputs whether `a` is greater than, equal to, or less than `b`.
- The logic uses basic `if`, `else if`, and `else` conditions to handle these comparisons.
- The program only prints one of the three possibilities based on the comparison result.
