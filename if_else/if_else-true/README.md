Let's break down the code you provided:

### Code:

```go
package main

func main() {
	a := 10
	b := 4
	c := 7
	d := 20

	if a > b && a > c && a > d {
		println("a is max")
	} else {
		println("a is not max")
	}
}
```

### **Explanation:**

#### 1. **Variable Initialization:**

```go
a := 10
b := 4
c := 7
d := 20
```
- The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned the values `10`, `4`, `7`, and `20`, respectively.

#### 2. **Condition Check with Logical AND (`&&`):**

```go
if a > b && a > c && a > d {
    println("a is max")
} else {
    println("a is not max")
}
```

- This `if` statement is checking if **all** the following conditions are true using the **logical AND operator** (`&&`):
  1. `a > b`: Checks if `a` (which is `10`) is greater than `b` (which is `4`). **True**, because `10 > 4`.
  2. `a > c`: Checks if `a` (which is `10`) is greater than `c` (which is `7`). **True**, because `10 > 7`.
  3. `a > d`: Checks if `a` (which is `10`) is greater than `d` (which is `20`). **False**, because `10` is **not greater** than `20`.

#### 3. **Logical AND (`&&`) Rule:**

- The logical AND operator (`&&`) ensures that **all** conditions must be `true` for the entire expression to be `true`. In this case:
  - The first two conditions (`a > b` and `a > c`) are `true`.
  - However, the third condition (`a > d`) is `false` because `10` is not greater than `20`.
  - Since one of the conditions is `false`, the entire condition evaluates to `false`.

#### 4. **Result of the `if` Statement:**

- Because the overall condition evaluates to `false`, the code inside the `else` block is executed:
  ```go
  println("a is not max")
  ```

### **Output:**
```
a is not max
```

### **Summary of the Rule:**
- **Logical AND (`&&`)**: All conditions connected by `&&` must be true for the entire expression to be true. If even one condition is false, the entire expression evaluates to false.
- In this case, because `a` is not greater than `d` (since `10` is not greater than `20`), the overall condition is false, so `"a is not max"` is printed.
