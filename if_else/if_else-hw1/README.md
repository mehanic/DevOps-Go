This Go program demonstrates several key concepts, including variable declarations, loops, conditionals, arrays, and functions. Let’s go through the different sections of the program to explain the logic and the output.

### **1. Function: `calculateGrade`**

```go
func calculateGrade(input_grade float32) string {
	if input_grade < 1.5 {
		return "F"
	} else if input_grade < 3 {
		return "D"
	} else if input_grade < 3 {
		return "C"
	} else if input_grade < 4 {
		return "B"
	} else {
		return "A"
	}
}
```

- **Purpose:** This function takes a `float32` value (`input_grade`) and returns a letter grade based on the value.
  - If `input_grade` is less than `1.5`, the grade is `F`.
  - If `input_grade` is between `1.5` and `3`, the grade is `D`.
  - There is an error in the logic here—two conditions for `input_grade < 3`. This will never reach the "C" grade.
  - If `input_grade` is between `3` and `4`, it returns `B`, and anything greater than `4` will return `A`.

### **2. Main Program:**

#### **Variables and Constants**

```go
const name = "Boonkwang"
const studentNo = 1

fmt.Print("My name is ", name, "\nMy student number is ", studentNo, "\n")
```

- `name` is a constant string with the value `"Boonkwang"`, and `studentNo` is a constant integer `1`.
- The `fmt.Print` statement prints these constants to the console:
  - Output: `My name is Boonkwang`
  - `My student number is 1`

#### **Variable Declarations**

```go
var teacher1 string = "goodnight"
teacher2 := "goodnight"
fmt.Println("teacher1", teacher1)
fmt.Println("teacher2", teacher2)
```

- `teacher1` is declared using the `var` keyword, and its value is assigned as `"goodnight"`.
- `teacher2` is declared using shorthand syntax (`:=`) with the same value, `"goodnight"`.
- Both variables are printed:
  - Output: 
    - `teacher1 goodnight`
    - `teacher2 goodnight`
- Afterward, `teacher1` is assigned the value of `name` (`"Boonkwang"`) and printed again:
  - Output: `teacher1 Boonkwang`

#### **Array and Loop for Students and Grades**

```go
var students [4]string
students[0] = "Kutui"
students[1] = "Munbod"
students[2] = "Khing"
students[3] = "Mali"
fmt.Println("student", students)

var grades [4]float32
grades[0] = 1.5
grades[1] = 4
grades[2] = 2
grades[3] = 3
fmt.Println("grade", grades)

for index := 0; index < 4; index++ {
	fmt.Printf("index %d my name is %v grade= %.2f \n", index, students[index], grades[index])
}
```

- Two arrays are declared: `students` and `grades`. `students` stores the names of students, and `grades` stores their corresponding grades.
- The program then uses a `for` loop to iterate over both arrays, printing each student’s name along with their grade.
  - Output:
    ```
    student [Kutui Munbod Khing Mali]
    grade [1.5 4 2 3]
    index 0 my name is Kutui grade= 1.50
    index 1 my name is Munbod grade= 4.00
    index 2 my name is Khing grade= 2.00
    index 3 my name is Mali grade= 3.00
    ```

#### **Actor Names Loop**

```go
var actors [6]string
actors[0] = "Khawtu"
actors[1] = "Gookgik"
actors[2] = "Boonkwang"
actors[3] = "Meemee"
actors[4] = "Nadech"
actors[5] = "Yaya"

for index := 0; index < 6; index++ {
	println("Actor name :", actors[index])
}
```

- An array of actor names is created and populated.
- A `for` loop prints out the name of each actor:
  - Output:
    ```
    Actor name : Khawtu
    Actor name : Gookgik
    Actor name : Boonkwang
    Actor name : Meemee
    Actor name : Nadech
    Actor name : Yaya
    ```

#### **Math Operations and Loops**

```go
x := 100
y := 0
for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
	fmt.Println("X = ", x+y)
	y = y + 100
}
```

- This loop increments `y` by 100 in each iteration and prints the value of `x + y`:
  - Output:
    ```
    X =  100
    X =  200
    X =  300
    X =  400
    X =  500
    ```

#### **Multiplication Table**

```go
for index := 1; index <= 10; index++ {
	fmt.Println(index * 2)
}
```

- This loop multiplies each number from `1` to `10` by `2` and prints the result:
  - Output:
    ```
    2
    4
    6
    8
    10
    12
    14
    16
    18
    20
    ```

#### **If-Else Conditional**

```go
const doingSomething = false
if doingSomething == true {
	fmt.Println("I'm doing")
} else {
	fmt.Println("Sorry I'm very lazy")
}
```

- The program checks if `doingSomething` is `true`. Since it's set to `false`, it prints:
  - Output: `Sorry I'm very lazy`

#### **Switch-Case**

```go
ii := 2
switch ii {
case 1:
	fmt.Println("one")
case 2:
	fmt.Println("two")
case 3:
	fmt.Println("three")
}
```

- A switch-case statement is used to print the corresponding case based on the value of `ii`. Since `ii = 2`, it prints:
  - Output: `two`

#### **Grade Calculation**

```go
fmt.Printf("grade is %v \n", calculateGrade(3.2))
```

- This prints the grade based on the input `3.2` by calling the `calculateGrade` function. Since `3.2` is between `3` and `4`, the function returns `B`:
  - Output: `grade is B`

### **Final Output:**

```
My name is Boonkwang
My student number is 1
teacher1 goodnight
teacher2 goodnight
teacher1 Boonkwang
name Boonkwang
grade= 3.24324
student [Kutui Munbod Khing Mali]

index 0 my name is Kutui grade= 1.50
