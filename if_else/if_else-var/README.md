Let's break down the Go code you provided step by step:

### Code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	name := "Alice"  // Set the name value
	age := 10        // Set the age value

	if name == "Alice" {
		fmt.Println("Hi, Alice.")
	} else if age < 12 {
		fmt.Println("You are not Alice, kiddo.")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("You are neither Alice nor a little kid.")
	}
}
```

### **Explanation:**

#### 1. **Variable Initialization:**
```go
name := "Alice"  // Set the name value
age := 10        // Set the age value
```
- `name` is assigned the value `"Alice"`.
- `age` is assigned the value `10`.

#### 2. **If-Else Conditional Block:**
```go
if name == "Alice" {
    fmt.Println("Hi, Alice.")
} else if age < 12 {
    fmt.Println("You are not Alice, kiddo.")
} else {
    fmt.Println("You are neither Alice nor a little kid.")
}
```
- This `if-else` structure evaluates conditions in order, from top to bottom:
  
  - **First Condition:**
    ```go
    if name == "Alice" {
        fmt.Println("Hi, Alice.")
    }
    ```
    - This checks if `name` is equal to `"Alice"`. Since the value of `name` is `"Alice"`, this condition is **true**.
    - Therefore, the first block is executed, and `"Hi, Alice."` is printed.

  - **Second Condition (`else if`):**
    ```go
    else if age < 12 {
        fmt.Println("You are not Alice, kiddo.")
    }
    ```
    - This block would be checked only if the first condition was false. Since the first condition is true, this block is **not evaluated**.
    
  - **Third Condition (`else`):**
    ```go
    else {
        fmt.Println("You are neither Alice nor a little kid.")
    }
    ```
    - This block is the fallback option, and it would only be executed if all preceding conditions were false. However, since the first condition was true, this block is **not evaluated** either.

#### 3. **Outcome:**
- Since `name == "Alice"`, the first condition is **true**, and the corresponding block of code (`fmt.Println("Hi, Alice.")`) is executed, printing `"Hi, Alice."`.
- The rest of the `else if` and `else` branches are skipped because the `if` condition was satisfied.

### **Output:**
```
Hi, Alice.
```

### **Summary of the Rule:**
- **`if-else if-else` flow:**
  - The program checks the first condition (`name == "Alice"`). Since this is true, it prints `"Hi, Alice."` and skips the rest of the conditions.
  - If the first condition were false, the program would check the `else if` condition (`age < 12`), and if that were also false, it would execute the final `else` block.
  
- **The program follows the first true condition** and executes the corresponding block, skipping the rest of the checks.
