### **📌 Explanation of `switch` Statement in Go**

This Go program demonstrates **switch statements** and their behavior, including **fallthrough** and inline variable declaration.

### **🔹 Code Breakdown**

#### **1️⃣ Basic `switch` Case**
```go
	x := 42

	switch x {
	case 25:
		fmt.Println("X is 25")
	case 42:
		fmt.Println("X is the magical 42")
		// Fallthrough will continue to next case
		fallthrough
	case 100:
		fmt.Println("X is 100")
	case 1000:
		fmt.Println("X is 1000")
	default:
		fmt.Println("X is something else.")
	}
```

✅ `x := 42` → Assigns `42` to `x`.  
✅ `switch x {` → Evaluates `x` and matches it against cases.  
✅ **Case Matches:**  
   - `case 42:` → Prints `"X is the magical 42"`.  
   - `fallthrough` → Forces execution to continue into the **next case (`100`)**, even though `x != 100`.  
   - `"X is 100"` is printed.  
✅ **Expected Output:**
```
X is the magical 42
X is 100
```

#### **2️⃣ `switch` with Inline Variable Declaration**
```go
	// Like an if statement, a variable can be declared inside switch
	switch r := rand.Int(); r {
	case r % 2:
		fmt.Println("Random number r is even.")
	default:
		fmt.Println("Random number r is odd.")
	}
```
✅ `r := rand.Int();` → Generates a random integer and assigns it to `r`.  
✅ `switch r {` → Evaluates `r` and attempts to match cases.  
✅ **⚠️ ERROR: This code won't compile!**  
   - `case r % 2:` is incorrect because **`r % 2` is a value (0 or 1), not a valid case condition**.  
   - The case should be written like this:
   ```go
   switch r % 2 {
   case 0:
       fmt.Println("Random number r is even.")
   default:
       fmt.Println("Random number r is odd.")
   }
   ```
✅ **Corrected Expected Output:**
```
Random number r is even.
```
or
```
Random number r is odd.
```
(Random behavior makes it unpredictable.)

### **🔹 Key Takeaways**
✅ **Switch** is used as a cleaner alternative to multiple `if-else` statements.  
✅ **`fallthrough`** makes execution continue into the next case (even if it doesn't match).  
✅ **Inline variable declaration (`r := rand.Int()`)** is allowed in `switch`, but **case conditions must be constants or valid expressions**.  
✅ If no cases match, **`default` case** is executed.
