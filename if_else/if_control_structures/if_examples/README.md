This **Go program** demonstrates conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`) and scoped variables. Letâ€™s break it down step by step:

---

## **1. Importing Packages**
```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
)
```
- **`fmt`** â†’ Used for printing output.
- **`math/rand`** â†’ Used for generating random numbers.

---

## **2. Generating a Random Integer**
```go
x := rand.Int()
```
- `rand.Int()` generates a **random integer** (non-negative, potentially large).
- `x` is assigned this random value.

---

## **3. Conditional Checks for `x`**
```go
if x < 100 {
	fmt.Println("x is less than 100.")
}
```
- If `x` is **less than 100**, it prints `"x is less than 100."`.
- **No `else` block**, so it does nothing if `x` is **100 or more**.

```go
if x < 1000 {
	fmt.Println("x is less than 1000.")
} else if x < 10000 {
	fmt.Println("x is less than 10,000.")
} else {
	fmt.Println("x is greater than 10,000")
}
```
- If `x` is **less than 1000**, print `"x is less than 1000."`
- **Otherwise, if** `x` is **less than 10,000**, print `"x is less than 10,000."`
- **Otherwise (x is â‰¥ 10,000)**, print `"x is greater than 10,000"`

```go
fmt.Println("x:", x)
```
- Prints the random value of `x`.

---

## **4. Scoped Variable in `if` Statement**
```go
if n := rand.Int(); n > 1000 {
```
- This **declares `n` inside the `if` condition** and assigns it a **random number**.
- This means **`n` exists only inside this `if-else` block**.

```go
	fmt.Println("n is greater than 1000.")
	fmt.Println("n:", n)
```
- If `n > 1000`, it prints `"n is greater than 1000."` and its value.

```go
} else {
	fmt.Println("n is not greater than 1000.")
	fmt.Println("n:", n)
}
```
- Otherwise, it prints `"n is not greater than 1000."` and its value.

---

## **5. Scope of `n`**
```go
// n is no longer available past the if statement
```
- Since `n` was declared inside `if`, it **cannot be used** outside of that block.

---

## **Example Output**
If `rand.Int()` generates `x = 987` and `n = 1500`, you might see:
```
x is less than 1000.
x: 987
n is greater than 1000.
n: 1500
```
If `rand.Int()` generates `x = 12000` and `n = 800`, you might see:
```
x is greater than 10,000
x: 12000
n is not greater than 1000.
n: 800
```

---

## **Key Takeaways**
1. **`if-else` conditions** control flow based on comparisons.
2. **Chained conditions (`else if`)** allow multiple checks.
3. **Scoped variables in `if` statements** (`if n := rand.Int(); condition`) exist **only inside the block**.
4. **`rand.Int()` generates random numbers**, which can vary between runs.
