Let's break down the provided Go code and explain the rules around interfaces, method sets, and error handling in Go:

### Key Points in the Code:

1. **Interface Definition (`HTTPError`)**:
   ```go
   type HTTPError interface {
       error
       StatusCode() int
   }
   ```
   - This defines an interface `HTTPError` that:
     - **Embeds the `error` interface**: Meaning any type implementing `HTTPError` must have the `Error()` method (part of the `error` interface).
     - Has an additional method `StatusCode() int` that returns the HTTP status code associated with the error (e.g., 404 for "Not Found").

2. **Type Definition for `NotFoundError`**:
   ```go
   type NotFoundError struct{}
   ```
   - This defines a struct type `NotFoundError` that represents a "Not Found" error (404 HTTP status).

3. **Methods on `NotFoundError`**:
   ```go
   func (n *NotFoundError) Error() string {
       return "Not Found"
   }

   func (n NotFoundError) StatusCode() int {
       return http.StatusNotFound
   }
   ```
   - **`Error()` method**: This method is implemented with a **pointer receiver** (`*NotFoundError`). It returns the error message `"Not Found"`.
   - **`StatusCode()` method**: This method is implemented with a **value receiver** (`NotFoundError`). It returns the HTTP status code for "Not Found", which is `http.StatusNotFound` (404).

4. **`NewNotFoundError` Function**:
   ```go
   func NewNotFoundError() (*NotFoundError, error) {
       return new(NotFoundError), nil
   }
   ```
   - This function returns a pointer to a new `NotFoundError` (`*NotFoundError`) and an `error` (in this case, it returns `nil` as there is no actual error).
   - The function signature indicates that the return type is `(*NotFoundError, error)`.

5. **Using the `HTTPError` Interface**:
   ```go
   var httpErr HTTPError
   httpErr, _ = NewNotFoundError()
   fmt.Println(httpErr.StatusCode(), httpErr.Error()) // 404 Not Found
   ```
   - Here, a variable `httpErr` of type `HTTPError` is declared.
   - The `NewNotFoundError()` function is called to assign a pointer to `NotFoundError` (`*NotFoundError`) to `httpErr`.
   - Since `httpErr` now points to a `*NotFoundError`, and `*NotFoundError` implements the `HTTPError` interface (because it has both the `Error()` method with a pointer receiver and the `StatusCode()` method with a value receiver), we can call the methods `httpErr.StatusCode()` and `httpErr.Error()`.

### Detailed Explanation of Rules:

1. **Interfaces in Go**:
   - An interface in Go specifies a set of methods. A type is said to **implement** an interface if it provides all the methods required by that interface.
   - Go's interfaces are **implicit**, meaning a type doesn't have to explicitly declare that it implements an interface. If the type has the required methods, it automatically satisfies the interface.

2. **Method Sets and Receivers**:
   - The `Error()` method has a **pointer receiver** (`*NotFoundError`), meaning it can only be called on a **pointer to `NotFoundError`** (i.e., `*NotFoundError`).
   - The `StatusCode()` method has a **value receiver** (`NotFoundError`), meaning it can be called on both **value types** and **pointer types** of `NotFoundError`.
   
   Because the `*NotFoundError` type has both methods (`Error()` with a pointer receiver and `StatusCode()` with a value receiver), it **implements the `HTTPError` interface**.

3. **Returning Pointers to Structs**:
   - In the `NewNotFoundError()` function, `new(NotFoundError)` creates a pointer to a new `NotFoundError` and returns it.
   - This pointer (`*NotFoundError`) is returned as the value for `httpErr`, and this value implements the `HTTPError` interface.

4. **Assigning and Using the `HTTPError` Interface**:
   - In the main function:
     ```go
     var httpErr HTTPError
     httpErr, _ = NewNotFoundError()
     ```
     The `httpErr` variable is of type `HTTPError`, which can hold any type that implements the `HTTPError` interface (like `*NotFoundError` in this case).
   - After the assignment, `httpErr` is a **pointer to `NotFoundError`** (`*NotFoundError`), and we can call the methods `StatusCode()` and `Error()` on it:
     ```go
     fmt.Println(httpErr.StatusCode(), httpErr.Error()) // 404 Not Found
     ```

5. **Why the Code Works**:
   - **`*NotFoundError`** implements the `HTTPError` interface because:
     - It has the `Error()` method with a pointer receiver.
     - It has the `StatusCode()` method with a value receiver.
   - When we call `NewNotFoundError()`, we get a pointer to `NotFoundError` (`*NotFoundError`), which is compatible with the `HTTPError` interface, so we can assign it to the `httpErr` variable of type `HTTPError` and use its methods.

### Conclusion:

- The code demonstrates how Go's interfaces work, specifically how method sets and receivers (value and pointer receivers) impact the implementation of interfaces.
- A type implements an interface if it provides all the methods required by that interface.
- In this case, `*NotFoundError` implements the `HTTPError` interface because it has the necessary methods, and we can use it in a variable of type `HTTPError`.
