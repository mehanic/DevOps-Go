This Go program demonstrates the use of **concurrency**, **thread-safe maps**, and **atomic operations**. It uses `sync`, `sync/atomic`, and `sync.Once` to manage shared resources and ensures safe concurrent access to variables and data structures. Let's break down the program and explain each section.

---

### **Main Function Breakdown:**

1. **Creating `Ordinal` and `SafeMap` Instances:**

```go
o := NewOrdinal()
m := NewSafeMap()
```

- **`NewOrdinal()`** creates a new instance of the `Ordinal` struct. The `Ordinal` struct manages an atomic value (`ordinal`) that can only be initialized once, and it provides methods to get and increment that value.
  
- **`NewSafeMap()`** creates a new instance of the `SafeMap` struct, which holds a `map` and a `sync.RWMutex`. This ensures safe concurrent read/write access to the map by using locks.

2. **Initializing Ordinal:**

```go
o.Init(1123)
fmt.Println("initial ordinal is:", o.GetOrdinal())
```

- **`Init(val uint64)`** is called on the `Ordinal` instance `o`. This method uses the `sync.Once` mechanism to ensure that the ordinal value is only set once, preventing any accidental re-initialization.
  
- **`GetOrdinal()`** retrieves the current value of the `ordinal`. At this point, the initial value is set to `1123`.

3. **Concurrency with Goroutines:**

```go
wg := sync.WaitGroup{}
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    wg.Add(1)
    go func(i int) {
        defer wg.Done()
        m.Set(fmt.Sprint(i), "success")
        o.Increment()
    }(i)
}
```

- **`sync.WaitGroup{}`** is used to wait for all goroutines to finish before proceeding. The `Add(1)` function increments the counter, and `Done()` decrements it when each goroutine finishes.
  
- **`go func(i int)`** launches a new goroutine that runs concurrently. Inside each goroutine:
  - The `SafeMap`'s **`Set(key, value)`** method is called to store a key-value pair where the key is the string representation of `i` (from 0 to 9), and the value is `"success"`.
  - **`Increment()`** is called on the `Ordinal` instance `o`, incrementing the `ordinal` value.

4. **Waiting for All Goroutines to Finish:**

```go
wg.Wait()
```

- This ensures that the program waits for all the concurrent operations (goroutines) to complete before continuing.

5. **Checking the SafeMap:**

```go
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    v, err := m.Get(fmt.Sprint(i))
    if err != nil || v != "success" {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

- After all goroutines have finished, this loop checks if all keys (from `"0"` to `"9"`) exist in the `SafeMap` and if their value is `"success"`.
- **`m.Get(key)`** uses the `Get` method of the `SafeMap` to read the value of each key. If the key doesn't exist or has an incorrect value, the program panics.

6. **Final Output:**

```go
fmt.Println("final ordinal is:", o.GetOrdinal())
fmt.Println("all keys found and marked as: 'success'")
```

- Finally, it prints the final value of `ordinal` (after all goroutines have incremented it) and confirms that all keys in the map are marked as `"success"`.

### **Structs and Methods Breakdown:**

#### **SafeMap:**

The `SafeMap` struct ensures thread-safe access to the underlying map (`m`). It uses a `sync.RWMutex` to handle concurrency:

- **`Set(key, value string)`**:
  - This method uses a **write lock** (`mu.Lock()`) to ensure exclusive access to the map for setting values. It then updates the map and releases the lock after the update is done.

- **`Get(key string)`**:
  - This method uses a **read lock** (`mu.RLock()`) to allow multiple goroutines to read the map concurrently without blocking each other. If the key exists, it returns the value. If not, it returns an error.

#### **Ordinal:**

The `Ordinal` struct manages a single `uint64` value (`ordinal`) that can only be initialized once, and it supports atomic operations for getting and incrementing the value:

- **`Init(val uint64)`**:
  - The **`sync.Once`** type ensures that the `Init` method is executed only once, preventing the ordinal value from being set more than once.

- **`GetOrdinal()`**:
  - This method retrieves the current value of `ordinal` using the **`atomic.LoadUint64()`** function, ensuring safe concurrent access.

- **`Increment()`**:
  - This method increments the `ordinal` value using **`atomic.AddUint64()`**, which safely increments the value in a thread-safe manner, ensuring that multiple goroutines can increment the ordinal concurrently without race conditions.

### **Concurrency and Atomic Operations:**

- **Concurrency Handling with Goroutines:**
  - The program uses goroutines to concurrently update the map and increment the ordinal value. The use of a `sync.WaitGroup` ensures that the main thread waits for all the goroutines to finish before proceeding with the checks.

- **Thread-Safety:**
  - The `SafeMap` uses a `sync.RWMutex` to ensure that reading and writing operations on the map are thread-safe.
  - The `Ordinal` struct uses **atomic operations** (`atomic.StoreUint64`, `atomic.LoadUint64`, and `atomic.AddUint64`) to ensure that the value of `ordinal` is safely accessed and modified in a concurrent environment.

- **Ensuring Single Initialization with `sync.Once`:**
  - The `sync.Once` mechanism ensures that the `ordinal` value is initialized only once, preventing accidental re-initialization.

### **Expected Output:**

```
initial ordinal is: 1123
final ordinal is: 1133
all keys found and marked as: 'success'
```

1. **Initial Ordinal**: The ordinal value is initialized to `1123`.
2. **Final Ordinal**: After all goroutines have run and incremented the ordinal value 10 times, the final ordinal value is `1133` (`1123 + 10`).
3. **All Keys Found and Marked as 'Success'**: The program checks that all keys in the `SafeMap` are present and have the value `"success"`, and if not, it will panic. Since the map was correctly updated by all goroutines, this check passes.

---

### **Key Concepts and Takeaways:**

1. **Concurrency Control**:
   - Use of **goroutines** and **`sync.WaitGroup`** to execute tasks concurrently and wait for them to finish.
   - **`sync.RWMutex`** for safe concurrent read/write access to a map.
   - **`sync.Once`** to ensure that the ordinal value is initialized only once.

2. **Atomic Operations**:
   - **`atomic.StoreUint64`** and **`atomic.AddUint64`** provide atomic operations to safely modify the `ordinal` value in a concurrent environment.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The program checks if all the keys in the `SafeMap` are correctly set and if the values are as expected, and it uses `panic` if something goes wrong.
