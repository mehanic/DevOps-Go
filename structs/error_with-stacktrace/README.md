This Go program demonstrates how to define a custom error type that includes a stack trace and how to handle and print this stack trace when the error occurs. Let's break down the code and explain the rules behind it:

### Key Concepts:

1. **Custom Error Type (`WithStacktraceError`):**
   - The `WithStacktraceError` struct is a custom error type that contains two fields:
     - `message`: A string that represents the error message.
     - `stacktrace`: A byte slice that stores the stack trace of the error.
   - This custom error type implements the `Error()` method, which is required to fulfill the `error` interface in Go, allowing it to be treated as an error.

   ```go
   type WithStacktraceError struct {
       message    string
       stacktrace []byte
   }
   
   func (w *WithStacktraceError) Error() string {
       return w.message
   }
   
   func (w *WithStacktraceError) StackTrace() string {
       return string(w.stacktrace)
   }
   ```

   - **`Error()` method**: This method is part of the `error` interface in Go, and it returns the error message.
   - **`StackTrace()` method**: This method returns the stack trace as a string (by converting the `[]byte` stack trace into a string), which is useful for debugging.

2. **Capturing a Stack Trace (`debug.Stack()`):**
   - `debug.Stack()` from the `runtime/debug` package captures the current goroutine's stack trace.
   - This stack trace is then included in the custom error, making it available for later inspection.

   ```go
   stacktrace: debug.Stack(),
   ```

3. **Function `doSomething()` Returning the Custom Error:**
   - The `doSomething()` function simulates an operation that results in an error. In this case, it creates and returns an instance of `WithStacktraceError`, which includes both a message and the stack trace.
   - The stack trace is captured at the time the error is created by calling `debug.Stack()`.

   ```go
   func doSomething() error {
       return &WithStacktraceError{
           message:    "something went wrong",
           stacktrace: debug.Stack(),
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Handling the Error in `main()` Function:**
   - In the `main` function, the error returned by `doSomething()` is checked using a **type assertion** to see if it is of type `*WithStacktraceError`. This is done by asserting the error type to the `*WithStacktraceError` type.
   - If the error is of the expected type, the program prints the error message and the stack trace.

   ```go
   if err := doSomething(); err != nil {
       if stacktraceErr, ok := err.(*WithStacktraceError); ok {
           fmt.Printf("%s\n%s", stacktraceErr.Error(), stacktraceErr.StackTrace())
       }
   }
   ```

   - **Type assertion (`err.(*WithStacktraceError)`)**: This checks whether `err` is a pointer to `WithStacktraceError`. If it is, it gives you access to the `Error()` and `StackTrace()` methods of that specific error type.

5. **Output:**
   - If the error is of type `*WithStacktraceError`, it will print both the error message and the stack trace.
   
   Example output:
   ```
   something went wrong
   goroutine 1 [running]:
   runtime/debug.Stack()
   	/home/mehanic/.gvm/gos/go1.23.0/src/runtime/debug/stack.go:26 +0x5e
   main.doSomething(...)
   	/home/mehanic/structure/13.error/error-examples/03-go-errors-concept/error-with-stacktrace/main.go:24
   main.main()
   	/home/mehanic/structure/13.error/error-examples/03-go-errors-concept/error-with-stacktrace/main.go:29 +0x25
   ```

   - **`something went wrong`**: This is the message from the `Error()` method of the custom error.
   - The following lines represent the stack trace, which shows:
     - The `runtime/debug.Stack()` function (in `stack.go:26`) where the stack trace was captured.
     - The call to `main.doSomething()` in `main.go:24`.
     - The call to `main.main()` in `main.go:29`.
   - The stack trace includes the file paths and line numbers, making it easier to trace where the error occurred.

### Detailed Explanation of the Flow:

1. **Custom Error Creation:**
   - When `doSomething()` is called, it creates a new `WithStacktraceError` instance, which contains the error message ("something went wrong") and the stack trace captured by `debug.Stack()`.

2. **Type Assertion to Access Stack Trace:**
   - In the `main` function, the returned error is type-asserted to a `*WithStacktraceError`. This is done with the line:
     ```go
     if stacktraceErr, ok := err.(*WithStacktraceError); ok {
     ```
   - If the assertion is successful, the program can call both `stacktraceErr.Error()` and `stacktraceErr.StackTrace()` to print the error message and the stack trace.

3. **Printing the Error and Stack Trace:**
   - The program prints the error message using `stacktraceErr.Error()`.
   - Then, it prints the stack trace using `stacktraceErr.StackTrace()`, which will give the developer valuable information about where the error occurred in the code.

4. **Advantages of This Approach:**
   - **Enhanced Debugging**: Including the stack trace in the error helps developers understand exactly where the error originated from, making debugging easier.
   - **Custom Error Types**: Defining custom error types with additional methods (like `StackTrace()`) allows for more flexibility in error handling.
   - **Type Assertion**: Using type assertion allows you to access specific methods (like `StackTrace()`) that are only available in custom error types, enabling more detailed error handling.

### Conclusion:

This program demonstrates how to:
- Create a custom error type that includes both an error message and a stack trace.
- Capture the stack trace using `debug.Stack()` to provide more context about the error's origin.
- Use type assertion to extract additional information from custom error types.
- Print both the error message and the stack trace to aid in debugging.

This approach improves error handling and debugging in Go, especially in complex applications where understanding the flow of execution and locating errors is crucial.
