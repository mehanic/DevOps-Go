The provided Go code explores error handling with `errors.As` and `errors.Is` as well as implementing custom error types. Specifically, it demonstrates how Go handles type assertions and error wrapping in a variety of ways.

Letâ€™s go through the code and the key rules and concepts it covers:

### Key Concepts and Rules:

#### 1. **`errors.As` for Type Assertions:**

   - `errors.As` is used to check if an error (or an error chain) can be asserted to a specific type. This function helps when dealing with error types that might be wrapped inside other errors.
   - `errors.As(err, &target)` checks whether `err` can be converted into a value of the target type (which is passed as a pointer). If `err` is an error of that type or wraps an error of that type, the function returns `true` and assigns the target to the value wrapped inside `err`.

   Example:
   ```go
   switch {
   case errors.As(err, &t):
       // Handle case where err is of type *template.ExecError or wraps it
   case errors.As(err, &tPtr):
       // Handle case where err is of type *template.ExecError (pointer)
   }
   ```

   - **Note**: If the target type is a pointer, Go will attempt to find the actual error wrapped inside `err` and assign it to that pointer.
   - **Important**: `errors.As` doesn't panic when the type assertion fails. It only returns `false` if the type doesn't match.

#### 2. **`errors.As` with Pointers and Non-Pointers:**

   - The code demonstrates two ways of using `errors.As`:
     1. **Using a non-pointer target (`t`)**: The first case in the switch statement tries to match the error `err` with `template.ExecError` directly.
     2. **Using a pointer target (`tPtr`)**: The second case tries to match `err` with a pointer to `template.ExecError`.

   The target must be either a pointer or an addressable variable. If the target type doesn't match or the error cannot be converted, the program will not panic but continue with the next case.

   ```go
   var (
       t    template.ExecError
       tPtr *template.ExecError
   )
   switch {
   case errors.As(err, &t):  // Checks if err is of type *template.ExecError
   case errors.As(err, &tPtr): // Checks if err is of type *template.ExecError pointer
   }
   ```

   - **Type Match**: For the first case (`&t`), if `err` is of type `template.ExecError` or wraps an error of that type, it will work.
   - **Pointer Type Match**: In the second case (`&tPtr`), it checks if `err` is specifically a pointer to `template.ExecError`.

#### 3. **Using `errors.As` with `net.DNSError`:**

   The code snippet demonstrates how `errors.As` works with a specific error type (`net.DNSError`).

   ```go
   var (
       n    net.DNSError
       nPtr *net.DNSError
   )
   switch {
   case errors.As(err, &nPtr): // Checks if err is of type *net.DNSError
   }
   ```

   - Here, `errors.As` checks if `err` is of type `*net.DNSError` and if it wraps an error of that type.

#### 4. **Panic Risk with `errors.As` on Non-Pointer Types:**

   The commented-out code in the switch statement shows a potential pitfall where using `errors.As` with a non-pointer type can cause a panic:
   ```go
   // case errors.As(err, &n): // This would panic!
   ```

   **Why this would panic**: `errors.As` requires the target to be a pointer (or a reference). If `n` is a non-pointer value (i.e., `net.DNSError`), this will panic because `errors.As` expects a pointer, but it was provided with a value.

   - **Correct usage**: Always use a pointer to check for type assertions.
     ```go
     var nPtr *net.DNSError
     errors.As(err, &nPtr)  // Correct!
     ```

#### 5. **Custom Error Implementation (`MyExecError`)**:

   - **`Error()` Method**: The `MyExecError` type implements the `Error()` method, which is required to make it an error type.
     ```go
     func (m *MyExecError) Error() string {
         return "cool error"
     }
     ```

   - **`Is()` Method**: This method is used for comparing errors. The `Is()` method allows one error to check if it matches a target error. It is typically used with `errors.Is`.

     ```go
     func (m *MyExecError) Is(target error) bool {
         switch target.(type) {
         case *template.ExecError:
             // Perform comparison logic
         case template.ExecError:
             // Perform comparison logic
         }
         return false
     }
     ```

     - **Question in the Code**: The code comments ask what logic should be used for `Is()`. The general pattern is to match the error type in `target`. If `target` is an error of type `*template.ExecError`, we can return `true` or compare the values.

   - **`As()` Method**: The `As()` method is used to attempt to assign the error to a target type, typically for extracting information from wrapped errors. The `As()` method works similarly to `Is()` but is used for type assertion.

     ```go
     func (m *MyExecError) As(target any) bool {
         switch target.(type) {
         case *template.ExecError:
             // Attempt to assign error value here
         case **template.ExecError:
             // Attempt to assign pointer to pointer type
         }
         return false
     }
     ```

     - **Question in the Code**: Similar to `Is()`, it asks what should be selected for `As()`. Typically, you'd use a pointer to the desired type or a double pointer (e.g., `**template.ExecError`) for more complex scenarios.

#### 6. **`Is()` and `As()` for Error Handling:**

   - **`Is()` Method**: The `Is()` method checks if an error is equivalent to another error, either by direct comparison or by examining its chain of wrapped errors.
   - **`As()` Method**: The `As()` method is used to extract a specific type of error from the error chain, attempting a type assertion.

   **Important Notes**:
   - **`Is()`** is used for comparing errors, and it works with both direct matches and wrapped errors.
   - **`As()`** is used for extracting the actual type of the error (e.g., to access its fields) from the error chain.

### Summary of Rules:

1. **`errors.As`**: Used for type assertion, ensuring that the error matches a specific type or can be extracted from the chain of wrapped errors. The target must be a pointer.
2. **Avoid Panic with Non-Pointers**: Using `errors.As` with a non-pointer type directly (e.g., `net.DNSError`) will panic. Always use a pointer or a reference.
3. **Custom Error Types**:
   - Implement `Error()`, `Is()`, and `As()` for custom error types to make them compatible with Go's error handling mechanisms.
   - `Is()` is used for comparing errors (with or without wrapping).
   - `As()` is used for extracting a specific type from the error chain.
